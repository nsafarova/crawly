You can read my previous posts on vaccine passports, why this summer will be really weird, and more, here. The joint recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 13 to “pause” the use of Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) Janssen vaccine was a very unwelcome surprise. Prior to the announcement, the pace of vaccination had been expanding every week, partly due to the increased supply of the J&J vaccine.

Here’s an explainer that answers as many of those questions as carefully as is currently possible — no doubt more answers will come every day. What happened?

But once the vaccine is authorized and millions of people have begun receiving it, sometimes researchers learn about other even rarer side effects not captured in the trials.

But in recent years, the shampoo — made with a scalp-tingling peppermint and packaged in an apothecary-like bottle to evoke medicine for hair — has become the brand’s top seller, says co-founder Sacha Mitic.

The information at our fingertips is unprecedented. But it can get drowned out in an endless glut of noise. It’s getting harder to read things — and write things — that actually matter. That’s why we’re building Medium. Our mission is to move thinking forward on the urgent issues shaping today and the next 100 years through honest, reflective conversation. We’re looking for teammates who are galvanized by this challenge, who dare to root for the underdog, who are deeply thoughtful and empathetic, and who love that words still mean something. Sound like you? We’d love to talk. You’re in good company Medium celebrates diversity in people, backgrounds, and life experiences. For instance, our founder co-created two of the most transformative tools for sharing ideas online, Blogger and Twitter. Our head of user services was once the lead singer of a popular band (and brought the drummer to work at Medium, too). One of our designers can lecture for an hour about the finer points of Polish typography. We also have quite a few outdoor explorers, podcast fanatics, amateur chefs, and inspiring mothers and fathers who balance leadership with parenthood. A mindful place to work We’re building a company, not just a product. That means we put a ton of thought into how we structure, how we interact, and how we build. Experimentation is encouraged at Medium, and we do it a lot. Sometimes we don’t get things right, and that’s okay too. Failure is seen as an opportunity for growth. Have an impact At Medium, you aren’t constrained by your job description. There’s room for you, and your ideas, to breathe. We empower people to draw on their own experience and knowledge to make decisions for themselves. With a strong focus on growth and personal development, Medium is the ideal place to develop your skills in an environment that is built on mutual trust and respect. Team members work with their managers (“Group Leads” in Medium speak) to get personalized 1:1 coaching and mentorship to help them grow and achieve their career goals.

Credit...Clive Brunskill/Getty Images The fallout from the Super League is spreading The biggest business and policy story in the world at the moment isn’t about taxes or infrastructure. It’s about the fate of European soccer, as the fight over the Super League draws in everyone from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase to President Emmanuel Macron of France to the N.B.A. star LeBron James. Critics have denounced the proposed league, which would guarantee 15 of Europe’s top teams a spot, as a cash grab by the richest clubs. We’ve also heard from sports executives who argue that the plan could hurt the economies of cities whose teams are excluded. JPMorgan, which is backing the plan, faces a backlash. Irate soccer fans denounced the bank for providing over $4 billion to finance the creation of the league. (“#JPMorgan” was a trending topic on Twitter yesterday, and not in a good way.) The bank was brought into the deal through its relationship with the Super League’s chief architect, Florentino Pérez, the billionaire president of Real Madrid. Its bet is that supporting a star-studded competition, in a sport with a gigantic worldwide fandom will pay off in the long run, not least through broadcast rights. JPMorgan’s involvement was vetted by its internal reputation committee, which assesses high-profile and potentially controversial assignments, according to people briefed on the decision. But that committee didn’t fully expect the emotional reaction from sports fans that has flooded the airwaves around the world, these people added. Big media and tech companies could get entangled. Many are expected to bid on the broadcast rights for the Super League, with speculation surrounding Amazon, Apple and Facebook. But they may have to worry about more than ratings. Political leaders like Mr. Macron and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain (and even Prince William) have spoken out against the league; is that a fight they want? And do they want to run afoul of FIFA, the sport’s global governing body, or UEFA, its European counterpart, and risk losing out on rights to the World Cup or other high-profile competitions? Others in the sports world tied to the proposal may get caught in the middle. Mr. James, for instance, is a part-owner of Liverpool, a founding member of the Super League, through his partnership with the Fenway Sports Group. But he wasn’t involved in the club’s decision to join the league, a person briefed on the matter said. Nevertheless, there is growing concern that athletes outside European soccer and minority owners of teams could get pulled into the global debate over the league, potentially putting them at odds with fans of the world’s most popular sport. Image HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The White House seeks to exploit a rift between big business and Republicans. The Biden administration is courting corporate America to support its infrastructure initiative, taking advantage of a rift with Republicans over political and social issues like restrictions on voting rights. But opposition to higher taxes and more regulation may yet reunite the estranged allies. Exxon Mobil unveils a $100 billion plan to profit from carbon capture. The oil giant said it would make a business based on trapping the carbon emissions of industrial plants around Houston. But the strategy would require government support, including a new carbon tax — which has little political backing. Amazon is accused of corrupting the recent warehouse unionization election. The union, which lost the vote 2-to-1, said the e-commerce giant had intimidated and surveilled workers. If the National Labor Relations Board agrees with the claims, it could order a new election. Xi Jinping warns against economic decoupling. In a speech today, the Chinese president called for greater global economic integration and made thinly veiled critiques of America’s efforts to reduce its dependence on Chinese exports like computer chips. “Bossing others around or meddling in others’ internal affairs will not get one any support,” Mr. Xi said. Oatly files for an I.P.O. The oat milk company — whose backers include Oprah Winfrey, Blackstone and the state-owned Chinese conglomerate China Resources — disclosed in its prospectus that sales more than doubled last year, to $421 million, though it lost about $60 million. It’s reportedly aiming for a $10 billion valuation, betting on the plant-based food trend. Image Image Credit...Majority Action, SEIU Activists send a message to asset managers More than 140 racial justice leaders published an open letter in The Financial Times urging asset managers to match their pledges on social and political issues with their votes at coming shareholder meetings. Of top importance: votes on board diversity, racial equity and political spending disclosures. The top three asset managers have significant power to influence corporate decisions. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street control about 80 percent of all indexed money, making them a dominant force in the governance of public companies. The activists behind today’s letter — including Rashad Robinson, the president of Color Of Change; Alicia Garza, the principal of Black to the Future; and Derrick Johnson, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. — argue that the money managers are not sufficiently exercising their power: In 2020, BlackRock voted against all 48 resolutions to expand policy-influence disclosures that received more than 20 percent shareholder support at S&P 500 companies. Of the 178 S&P 500 companies that had no Black directors as of their 2020 annual shareholder meetings, BlackRock voted to support the entire board at 163 and Vanguard did the same at 166. The “big three” asset managers made commitments to racial justice after the killing of George Floyd last year. They’ve incorporated that focus into their voting guidelines: BlackRock has said it may vote against directors when it considers a board to be “insufficiently diverse.” State Street said it would vote against certain directors at firms that do not disclose diversity data this year and firms that do not have at least one director from an underrepresented community next year. When it comes to voting rights, BlackRock and Vanguard signed a recent letter opposing “any discriminatory legislation” that would make voting more difficult. The activists are asking funds to do more, including: Oppose all-white boards. Oppose directors in charge of political spending at corporations that “failed to address their role in funding elected officials” in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. Support shareholder demands for racial equity audits. The letter sets the stage for a potentially contentious proxy season, targeting specific shareholder resolutions at a host of S&P 500 companies in its “voting guide” for investors. Neuberger Berman, which manages $429 billion in assets, said yesterday it plans to vote against management at Berkshire Hathaway on topics including diversity reporting, which also features in the activists’ guide. “We’re trying to behave like owners and shareholders and help make the company better,” Neuberger’s C.E.O., George Walker, told CNBC. “Software, data, electronics and biology are changing the world. But they won’t reach every American or ensure national competitiveness without public investment.” — Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, on his support for the Biden Administration’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure plan in a USA Today op-ed. (He did not address the increase in corporate taxes that would pay for it.) Image What can public companies reveal through private channels like Discord and Substack? Yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook is expanding into audio, including Clubhouse-style chat rooms, podcasting and more. An interesting wrinkle about the announcement was that it was made in a private Discord chat with Casey Newton, a reporter who writes a Substack subscription newsletter. Facebook sent a message that the traditional gatekeepers are gone. The private channel chat was just one sign; another was Mr. Zuckerberg saying so explicitly. “If you look at the grand arc here, what’s really happening is individuals are getting more power and more opportunity to create the lives and the jobs that they want,” he said of the new media age. What about fair disclosure? Mr. Zuckerberg was speaking on social media but using a restricted channel. Companies can’t selectively disclose material information but the S.E.C. has said that “most social media are perfectly suitable methods for communicating with investors.” Still, the rules were designed to ensure that no one can get a jump on other investors, so channels don’t qualify “if the access is restricted or if investors don’t know that’s where they need to turn to get the latest news.” Dan Primack of Axios asked, “So how does revealing big new product news on a private Discord server fit into that?” Assuming Facebook’s product announcement qualifies as material — which given the company’s size it may not — past rulings can help answer this question, which will arise more often as the media splinters into niche networks. “Issuers must take steps” to let investors know the news channels they’ll use, the S.E.C. wrote in a 2013 investigation of Netflix after its C.E.O., Reed Hastings, posted data about the company on his private Facebook page. The S.E.C. didn’t take action, noting “market uncertainty” about how fair-disclosure rules applied to social media at the time, and said it would consider each case individually. Facebook also published a blog post yesterday announcing its new audio products, which could help address fair disclosure concerns. A Facebook spokesperson told DealBook the post was intended to complement the Discord discussion.

The private channel chat was just one sign; another was Mr. Zuckerberg saying so explicitly. “If you look at the grand arc here, what’s really happening is individuals are getting more power and more opportunity to create the lives and the jobs that they want,” he said of the new media age. What about fair disclosure? Mr. Zuckerberg was speaking on social media but using a restricted channel. Companies can’t selectively disclose material information but the S.E.C. has said that “most social media are perfectly suitable methods for communicating with investors.” Still, the rules were designed to ensure that no one can get a jump on other investors, so channels don’t qualify “if the access is restricted or if investors don’t know that’s where they need to turn to get the latest news.” Dan Primack of Axios asked, “So how does revealing big new product news on a private Discord server fit into that?” Assuming Facebook’s product announcement qualifies as material — which given the company’s size it may not — past rulings can help answer this question, which will arise more often as the media splinters into niche networks. “Issuers must take steps” to let investors know the news channels they’ll use, the S.E.C. wrote in a 2013 investigation of Netflix after its C.E.O., Reed Hastings, posted data about the company on his private Facebook page. The S.E.C. didn’t take action, noting “market uncertainty” about how fair-disclosure rules applied to social media at the time, and said it would consider each case individually. Facebook also published a blog post yesterday announcing its new audio products, which could help address fair disclosure concerns. A Facebook spokesperson told DealBook the post was intended to complement the Discord discussion.

Getting into people’s inboxes can help you strengthen your connections, stay top of mind as opportunities come up, and learn about industry trends. But sometimes, you want to dive deeper than a few paragraphs. For that, my tool of choice is the good, old-fashioned phone call. I reserve at least an hour a day to take calls while going for a walk — it’s my all-in-one networking, ideation, and Vitamin D solution. I like to choose a mix of people to call every week: folks who challenge me, see things differently than me, and can fill in the blindspots in my career. Try the habit yourself. Here are the five calls you should make every week. A call that you use as a sounding board At the beginning of every week, my friend Marina Glazman and I send each other quick emails of what we’re working on, and then 24 hours later, we’ll hop on a call to hash out the list. I value Marina’s perspective on which ideas and tasks are an effective use of my time and which ones aren’t. I get a chance to vocalize my ideas, which helps me to quickly tighten my thinking. I might say to her: “Here are the bones of two articles I’m thinking about — do you have anything to add, subtract, or move around some to make the argument stronger?” Or: “I’m thinking about doing X. What am I missing?” If you do creative work for a living, find your own sounding board — someone with good taste who will give it to you straight. There’s something magical about having a thinking partner who knows both you and your work inside and out. It can seriously help drive your best ideas forward. A call to someone who stretches you Oliver Burkeman, the former life-advice columnist for The Guardian, once wrote that when deciding what we want to do with our careers, we should choose what stretches us over what comes easily. I like this idea. I think it’s also a good rule to follow when deciding who we should spend our time with. Get in front of someone who holds you to a standard that’s higher than you might even hold for yourself. For me, my “stretch” call each week is with Fred Dust, the former global managing partner of Ideo and the author of Making Conversations. During our calls, I try to impress him. Some people say you shouldn’t try to impress people, but I think that’s nonsense. We should absolutely want to impress people. The key, however, is getting clear on the type of people we want to impress and then doing everything we can to ensure their time is well spent when we’re in front of them. Fred makes me pick up my game because I want to keep the door open for future opportunities. A call to someone who’s doing something cool outside your lane If your focus is creating more opportunities, don’t underestimate the importance of getting to know people outside your lane — those whose work is tangentially related to your own. Say, if you’re a writer and only talk to other writers, you’ll be vying for the exact same opportunities as everyone else in your circle. But if you make a point to get to know founders, designers, and salespeople, you’ll be exposed to even more ideas, perspectives, and opportunities. A call to a former collaborator Make a habit of checking in with your old connections and asking them what they’ve been noticing in your industry. You might text them and say something like: “I came across this article and thought of you. It’s been a while. Want to hop on a call sometime and catch up?” Not only does this keep the door open for future collaborations, but you’ll also gain new insights as you fill each other in on what you’re seeing in the room you’re currently sitting in. A call to a younger mentor If you’re a few years or more into your career, find a mentor who’s younger than you. Most weeks, I spend at least 50% of my work time with people a decade younger than me, including the writers Amardeep Parmar, Stephen Moore, and Zulie Rane. Not only do they help me navigate online trends better than people my age or older, but they have a ton of energy, which motivates me to step up my energy, too. The world is moving fast and the majority of this change is tech-driven. The people who I want walking me through it all are those who have been working in this landscape since day one. I’d bet younger mentors would be happy to trade their knowledge for your wisdom and possible connections.

Learn about our editorial policies Theresa W. Carey Updated Mar 2, 2021 With so many different types of online stock brokers available to investors, it can be tough to choose one that works best for you. That’s why we put these U.S.-based online brokers through a comprehensive review process that included hands-on research to determine the best in the industry. Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms: Fidelity Investments: Best Overall TD Ameritrade: Best Broker for Beginners and Best Broker for Mobile tastyworks: Best Broker for Options and Best Broker for Low Costs Interactive Brokers: Best Broker for Advanced Traders and Best Broker for International Trading Charles Schwab: Best Broker for ETFs Fidelity Investments: Best Overall OPEN AN ACCOUNT Account Minimum: $0 Fees: $0 for stock/ETF trades, $0 plus $0.65/contract for options trade Read full review OPEN AN ACCOUNT Fidelity earned our top spot for the second year running by offering clients a well-rounded package of investing tools and excellent order executions. It has continued to quietly enhance key pieces of its mobile-responsive website while committing itself to lowering the cost of investing for its clients. Fidelity joined in the rush to cut equity and base options commissions to zero in October 2019 but remains devoted to offering top-quality research and education offerings to its clients.﻿﻿ The firm also makes it easy for clients to earn interest by sweeping uninvested cash into a money market fund. Fidelity also shares the revenue it generates from its stock loan program, and allows clients to choose which stocks in their portfolios can be loaned out.﻿﻿ Pros Fidelity provides excellent trade executions for investors. On average, over 96% of orders for Fidelity customers are executed at a price better than the national best bid or offer. Fidelity offers a wealth of research and extensive pre-set and customizable asset screeners. Your uninvested cash is automatically swept into a money market fund to help contribute to overall portfolio returns. Cons Some traders and sophisticated investors may have to use Fidelity’s web platform in addition to Active Trader Pro to access all the tools and research they require. Non-U.S. citizens or residents cannot open an account. Traders and investors must manually refresh the data when using the website. Fidelity has a wide offering of securities, but no commodities or options on futures. TD Ameritrade: Best for Beginners And Best Mobile App OPEN AN ACCOUNT Account Minimum: $0 Fees: Free stock, ETF, and per-leg options trading commissions in the U.S., as of October 3rd, 2019. $0.65 per options contract. Read full review OPEN AN ACCOUNT Best for Beginners: TD Ameritrade, one of the largest online brokers, has made significant efforts to market itself to beginner investors through social media. Work is still being done to further streamline its web and mobile experiences and make them more accessible to new users, but the resources new investors can already access are exceptional. Education is a key component of TD Ameritrade’s offerings. You’ll find expanded learning pathways, ranging from beginner to advanced, to help clients understand everything from basic investing concepts to extremely advanced derivatives strategies. You can open an account and poke around without making a deposit, and take advantage of all the learning opportunities until you’re comfortable. TD Ameritrade wants new investors to become more confident, and to trade additional asset classes as their skills grow. Best for Mobile: TD Ameritrade focused its 2019 development efforts on its most active clients, who are mobile-first – and in many cases, mobile-only. TD Ameritrade’s thinkorswim mobile platform has extensive features for active traders and investors alike. The workflow for options, stocks, and futures is intuitive and powerful. You’ll find lots of bells and whistles that make the mobile app a complete solution for most trading purposes, including streaming real-time data and the ability to trade from charts. The regular mobile platform is almost identical in features to the website, so it’s an easy transition. TD Ameritrade clients can trade all asset classes offered by the firm on the mobile apps. Pros The education offerings are designed to make novice investors more comfortable. TD Ameritrade offers in-person education at more than 280 offices as well as multiple training pathways available on its website and mobile apps. TD Ameritrade optimized its traditional website for mobile browsers with a dashboard where clients can quickly access account details. Streaming real-time data on thinkorswim’s mobile app is unlimited. Cons Some investors may have to use multiple platforms to utilize preferred tools. TD Ameritrade offers one of the widest selections of account types, so new investors may be unsure of which account type to choose when opening an account. More support is needed to ensure customers are starting out with the correct account type. Investors are paid a tiny rate of interest on uninvested cash (0.01-0.05%) unless they take action to move cash into money market funds. tastyworks: Best Broker for Options and Best Broker for Low Costs OPEN AN ACCOUNT Account Minimum: $0 Fees: $0.00 stock trades, $1.00 to open options trades $0.00 to close Read full review OPEN AN ACCOUNT Best for Options: Tastyworks officers say that more than 90% of the trades placed by their customers are derivatives, so there are a lot of tools for options and futures traders. Everything is designed to help the trader evaluate volatility and the probability of profit. It’s all about making decisions and taking action. Executions are fast and the costs are low, capping commissions for opening orders for options on equities and futures at $10 per leg.﻿﻿ As you build a position from a chart or from a volatility screener, a trade ticket is populated for you. There’s a video viewer embedded so you can keep an eye on the tastytrade network. Though a newcomer to options trading might be initially uncomfortable, those who understand the basic concepts will appreciate the content and features. Best for Low Costs: The qualification for this award is simple: the lowest out-of-pocket costs. Tastyworks fits that bill well, as customers pay no commission to trade U.S. equities online, and there is no per-leg fee for options trades. Tastyworks has a unique fee structure for options trades, charging $1 per contract to open a position, while closing trades are free. In addition, there is a maximum of $10 per leg for options trades, so traders who place large spread orders are happy. Pros All of the tools you’ll need for analyzing and trading derivatives are built into the tastyworks platform. The charting capabilities are uniquely tuned for the options trader. There are hours of original video from tastytrade every weekday, offering up-to-the-minute trading ideas, plus a huge library of pre-recorded videos and shows. Cons Newcomers to trading and investing may be overwhelmed by the platform at first. There’s a learning curve to climb. There is no fixed income trading (outside of ETFs that contain bonds) for those who want to allocate some of their assets to a more conservative asset class. Besides profit and loss, any additional portfolio analysis requires setting up a login on a separate site. Interactive Brokers: Best for Advanced Traders and Best for International Trading OPEN AN ACCOUNT Account Minimum: $0 Fees: Maximum $0.005 per share for Pro platform or 1% of trade value, $0 for IBKR Lite Read full review OPEN AN ACCOUNT Best for Advanced Traders: Interactive Brokers (IBKR) earns this award due to its wealth of tools for sophisticated investors and its wide pool of assets and markets. The firm makes a point of connecting to as many electronic exchanges as possible. You can trade equities, options, and futures around the world and around the clock. Interactive Brokers’ order execution engine stays on top of changes in market conditions to re-route all or parts of your order to achieve optimal execution, attain price improvement, and maximize any possible rebate. The order routing algorithms seek out a speedy execution and can access hidden institutional order flows (dark pools) to execute large block orders. The wide array of order types include a variety of algorithms as well as conditional orders such as one-cancels-another and one-triggers-another. You can also set up conditional orders based on price, volume, daily P&L, margin cushion, number of shortable shares available, rebate available from the trading venue, and other factors. Best for International Trading: Interactive Brokers is the best broker for international trading by a significant margin. Interactive Brokers allows investors to access 125 exchanges in 31 countries across the globe. This reach is combined with a massive inventory of assets and 60 different order types to plan your entry and exit from a position. Investors can also fund their account in their domestic currency and IBKR will handle the conversion at market rates when you want to buy assets denominated in a non-domestic currency. And, if all that were not enough, the quality of trading tools available through Traders Workstation (TWS) make it easy to execute multi-layered trades across international borders. Interactive Brokers has won this category two years running, and there is no sign of that changing in the near future. Pros IBKR’s order execution engine has what could be the smartest order router in the business. Interactive Brokers connects clients to 135 markets in 33 countries and enables clients to trade stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds and funds from a single integrated account. Algorithmic order types include VWAP (volume-weighted average price) and TWAP (time-weighted average price) as well as order types designed to minimize the trader’s impact on the price of a particular stock. Cons You can only have streaming data on one device at a time. This could be an issue for traders with a multi-device workflow. The most advanced capabilities are restricted to IBKR Pro clients and trades on that plan are not commission free. Most non-U.S. exchanges charge additional data fees that increase your trading costs. Charles Schwab: Best for ETFs OPEN AN ACCOUNT Account Minimum: $0 Fees: Free stock, ETF trading, $0.65 per options contract Read full review OPEN AN ACCOUNT Money is increasingly flowing out of the mutual fund industry and into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Some investors (and most robo-advisors) use ETFs exclusively to build a balanced portfolio meant to walk the optimal line between risk and reward. To determine the best online broker for investing in ETFs, we looked at research capabilities specific to finding the best ETFs for a customer’s specific purpose. Top-notch screeners, analyst reports, fundamental and technical data, and the ability to compare ETFs are the main components of this award. Schwab is a full-service investment firm which offers services and technology to everyone from self-directed active traders to people who want the guidance of a financial advisor. It has a wide variety of platforms from which to choose, as well as full banking capabilities. It is, however, Schwab’s ETF screener on the StreetSmart Edge platform that will capture the attention of ETF investors. The StreetSmart Edge ETF screener has over 150 criteria that can combine fundamental, technical, and third party data. The ETF screener is extremely customizable and your criteria combinations can be saved for future re-use. Schwab’s news and research offerings overall were also among the deepest of all the brokerages we reviewed, sealing up this category for the industry giant. Pros The StreetSmart Edge ETF screener is the best among all online brokerages we reviewed. There are 16 predefined screens for the ETF screener which can be customized according to client needs. Results can be turned into a watchlist, or exported. The ETF screener is available to both prospects (pre-login) and clients using StreetSmart Edge. Schwab offers its clients free access to news feeds from BondSource, MarketEdge, Schwab Investing Insights Brief, Argus Research Alerts, Briefing.com, Morningstar Equity Research Alerts, Business Wire, PR Newswire, Credit Suisse, CFRA, and Vickers Insider Activity. Premium third-party research is offered at a discounted price. Cons In contrast to the excellent ETF screener in StreetSmart Edge, the ETF screener on the Schwab.com website is very basic. If you trade derivatives, most of the tools are on the StreetSmart Edge platform, but equities traders will wind up referring to technology on the standard website. Schwab does not automatically sweep uninvested cash into a money market fund, and their base interest rate is extremely low. What to Consider When Choosing an Online Broker When you are choosing an online stock broker you have to think about your immediate needs as an investor. Are you a beginner? Maybe you need a broker that has great educational material about the stock market. Do you only have a small amount of money you can put aside to invest? Some online brokers allow for small minimum deposits which can be a great option for those with limited funds. Are you always on the go and in need of a robust mobile platform? Some online brokers have incredible mobile apps delivering nearly all the features that their desktop counterparts do. Another important thing to consider is the distinction between investing and trading. When people talk about investing they generally mean the purchasing of assets to be held for a long period of time. These types of investments are usually made to reach a retirement goal or to put your money into assets that may grow faster than it would in a standard savings account accruing interest. Trading, on the other hand, most commonly involves the buying and selling of assets in short periods. Trading is generally considered riskier than investing. All of these factors must be considered before choosing an online broker. Do you want to trade or invest? Do you want a great mobile app to check your portfolio wherever you are? What types of assets are you looking to invest in? Answering these questions is not always easy.

As the name implies, high-yield savings accounts pay much higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts do. Typically offered online, whether by an internet-only bank or a brick-and-mortar institution, they’re based on the idea that it’s smart to hold your savings wherever it can earn a competitively high yield, even if that’s a different bank than where you hold your checking account. The difference in interest rates can be dramatic, with the top savings accounts in the country typically paying 15 to 20 times the national average rate. You can still keep your checking account where it is because it's simple to link a high-yield savings account to your primary account for easy transfers. Is My Money Safe in an Online Savings Account? The vast majority of banks, whether physical or online, carry FDIC insurance, which protects banking customers by insuring up to $250,000 of their deposits at any one institution in the event that the bank fails. The U.S. government similarly backs credit union customers up to $250,000 by providing NCUA insurance to the vast majority of credit institutions. So whether your institution has branches or is an internet-only bank, your deposits are equally safe and protected. Just be sure to check for the FDIC or NCUA logo before you begin doing business with any new financial institution. What Is the Difference Between a High-Interest Savings Account and a Money Market Account? Savings accounts and money market accounts are close cousins. Both allow you to move money in and out at your convenience, with their main function being to provide an option for you to sock away savings while earning interest on your balance. In addition, the federal regulation that limits savings account withdrawals to 6 per month is applied to both types of accounts. Traditionally, what differs between savings and money market accounts is that money market accounts include the option to write checks on the account. In contrast, savings accounts typically only allow fund withdrawals via electronic transfer, ATM cards (when offered), or in-branch visits. How Often Do Savings Rates Change? The APY that a savings account pays on the day you make your initial deposit is not guaranteed. In fact, the account’s rate can change at any time. Whether the rate goes up or down, and how often it changes, is largely influenced by the Federal Reserve. When it adjusts the federal funds rate, banks and credit unions often follow suit in the same direction. That said, rate changes among savings accounts are not typically a daily or weekly event. Barring recent moves by the Fed, rates often remain at the same level for weeks or months at a time. Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

A home warranty is a contract that helps homeowners cover the cost of repairing or replacing appliances and systems that break down or fail. Using home warranties, homeowners can get discounted repair and replacement services (up to certain limits) for covered items that fail during the coverage period. The best home warranty companies are those that offer a diverse set of coverage options, have high coverage limits and make it easy for homeowners to file claims. These companies also offer plenty of details about their offerings right on their websites, make it easy to purchase coverage, and are flexible when it comes time to choose a contractor.

Most people are very familiar with homeowners' insurance, which protects against any accidental damage to your home and belongings due to theft, fire, storms, and natural disasters. A home warranty protects your home, too, but it works differently. A home warranty is a service contract that helps pay for repairs and replacements for covered appliances and major home systems. For a monthly or annual fee, you can then pay a set service fee each time an appliance or system fails. In general, you don't need a home inspection or maintenance records to buy coverage. And it doesn't matter if your home is brand new or 50 years old. How Does a Home Warranty Work? After you choose a plan, service fee, and any add-on coverage, you pay upfront for the entire year or set up monthly payments. Most companies have a waiting period of 15 to 30 days after you buy the plan before coverage takes effect. Once that waiting period is over, you're free to start using the home warranty. If you bought or were given a home warranty as part of a real estate transaction, your coverage typically starts when you close on your new home. While the specifics depend on the company, here's a general rundown of how a home warranty works: If a covered appliance or system breaks down, you submit a claim with your home warranty company either online or by phone. Most companies have 24/7/365 customer service representatives ready to help you. Your home warranty company chooses a service provider. The service provider contacts you to set up an appointment. The technician comes to your home to diagnose the problem. If it's covered, the technician repairs or replaces the item. You pay the service fee to your home warranty company or directly to the technician (depending on your plan). The home warranty company covers the rest. What Does a Home Warranty Cover? A home warranty covers eligible appliances and systems in new and pre-owned homes. Many home warranty companies offer three types of plans, including: Appliance plans (e.g., washer/dryer, dishwasher, and refrigerator) Systems plans (e.g., air conditioning, heating, plumbing, and electrical) Combo plans that cover everything included in the appliance and systems plans Most companies allow you to add coverage for specific items not covered under the appliance or system plan. Add-ons include pools, spas, lawn sprinkler systems, additional appliances (such as a second air conditioner or refrigerator), wells, and septic systems. Source: Home Advisor. Investopedia / Julie Bang What Doesn't a Home Warranty Cover? While a home warranty can provide coverage in case home appliances or systems break down or fail due to normal wear and tear, warranties are not designed to replace existing homeowners insurance policies and they do not cover homeowners against many of the perils that are covered by homeowner policies. For example, warranties are not meant to cover repairs to a home's foundation or its structure due to accidents, nor do they cover homeowners against liability if someone gets hurt on their property. Additionally, home warranty plans have coverage limits or caps. For example, you may be covered for up to $2,000 per year per appliance, with an annual claim limit of $15,000. Take a close look at the fine print to be sure you understand what's covered by the plan and the limits that apply. This may be especially important if you have higher-end appliances and systems. Many (but not all) home warranty companies will also deny claims if an appliance or system: Was not installed correctly or maintained properly Was not used properly Does not meet local building codes Had a known or unknown pre-existing condition when you bought the warranty What Does a Home Warranty Cost? There are two costs to look at when you compare home warranty plans: the service fee and the monthly (or annual) cost. The service fee is the amount you pay each time you request service. These fees typically range between $55 and $150. Depending on the company, you can choose from one, two, or three service fees. In general, the lower the service fee, the more expensive the plan. If you need more than one type of technician for the same issue—for example, you need a plumber and an electrician to work on a water heater—you may owe two service fees. The monthly or annual cost is the amount you pay to have access to the ""discounted"" service calls. These costs range from about $350 to more than $1,100 a year, depending on the plan, service fee, house size, and where you live. Are Home Warranties Worth It? Whether a home warranty is right for you depends on a number of factors, including the age of your home, the quality of your appliances, and your own repair skills. In a recent interview with Chad Marzen, a home warranty expert and an American General Insurance Associate Professor of Insurance Law, he explained that ""If an individual has the funds to self-insure their appliances, then a home warranty may not necessarily be as pressing as the situation where maybe you are on a really tight budget and anticipate that an appliance may be in the last year or two or three of running. That might be more worth it for the consumer to get a home warranty to provide peace of mind. So, the issue of home warranties is a question of your risk tolerance for large expenses."" Every appliance and home system eventually breaks down. If you're handy, you might be able to do repairs yourself and save money. Many homeowners, however, don't have the skills, tools, time, and patience to do their own repairs. In these situations, a home warranty can make financial sense. Here's why: According to the ""1% rule,"" you should set aside at least one percent of your home's value each year to cover maintenance and repairs. For example, if your home cost $200,000, you should budget $2,000 a year for maintenance. Another rule—the ""square foot rule""—advises you to budget $1 per square foot. So, if your home is 2,000 square feet, you should set aside $2,000 a year. The annual cost of a home warranty could be well under those guidelines, even if you use the service several times a year. Say you have a $200,000 home and want to set aside the recommended $2,000 a year for maintenance. Now, assume you buy a home warranty instead. If the plan costs $500 a year and you have a $100 service fee, you could make 15 claims before reaching that $2,000 threshold. Of course, there's no way to tell if you would use the $2,000 you set aside—and if not, you can save it for the next year. Likewise, you can't predict if you'll use a home warranty if you buy one. Still, a home warranty often ends up saving money in the long run. And it can certainly help you budget and provide peace of mind. Methodology To review offerings available, we developed a home warranty review methodology that accounted for elements like coverage area, price, and service. We wanted to recommend companies that had broad coverage throughout the majority of the U.S. while keeping pricing in line with industry standards. We also considered the cost of trade service fees due at the time of a claim. Overall, we chose companies that priced their services fairly based on the industry norm. We then took a deep dive into the service each company provided, assessing how customers could address a claim and whether doing so was convenient. Finally, we looked at third-party reviews to see what real customers had to say about their claims experience to determine the companies with the best reputations. In the end, we balanced price with service for the best customer experience. Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Foreign transaction fee (%) 0% Why We Chose This Card Pros & Cons Why We Chose This Card The World of Hyatt Credit Card is our best for hotels because it consistently offers the highest point redemption value of any hotel program we have analyzed, though the points tend to be more challenging to accumulate compared to other hotel programs. The World of Hyatt Credit Card also offers a competitive one-time bonus—a complimentary night at a category 1-4 Hyatt hotel on each cardmember anniversary—and a very high earning rate on spend at Hyatt hotels. These benefits could quickly justify the card’s annual fee.

Foreign transaction fee (%) 0% Why We Chose This Card Pros & Cons Why We Chose This Card The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card has a bonus (potentially worth up to $750) as large or larger than the bonuses with many ultra-premium travel cards, with an annual fee that is substantially less than cards with competitive one-time bonuses. It also has flexible redemption options and generous rewards, making it one of the most valuable travel rewards cards on the market. It pays 2 points per dollar spent on travel and restaurant purchases, with each point worth a cent for cash back, but worth 1.25 cents if redeemed for travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards. The $95 annual fee can easily be justified by the travel and dining rewards you could earn over the course of a year.

Rewards Earning Rate This card does not offer a rewards program. Why We Chose This Card Pros & Cons Why We Chose This Card We chose the Citi Simplicity as the best balance transfer card primarily due to its exceptionally long 18-month 0% APR introductory period along with consumer-friendly terms like no annual fee and no late fees or penalty rates. While Simplicity offers no rewards, we don't consider that a negative in the case of a balance transfer card, as rewards can tempt counterproductive additional spending when trying to dig out from debt. Citi does charge a 3% balance transfer fee, but the length of the introductory period justifies the extra cost in terms of savings potential. Pros & Cons Pros Outstanding 0% APR offer for 18 months from account opening on balance transfers 0% introductory APR offer on new purchases for 18 months from account opening No late fees, penalty rates, or annual fees Cons High fee for balance transfers 3% foreign transaction fee No rewards program or one-time bonus offer Balance Transfer Runner-Up : Citi Diamond Preferred Overall Rating 3.7 Next Steps Recommended Credit Score Our recommended ranges are based off of the FICO® Score 8 credit-scoring model.

Why We Chose This Card Pros & Cons Why We Chose This Card The Citi Diamond Preferred is an excellent choice for transferring a balance. It offers a 0% introductory rate on purchases and balance transfers for 18 months. Balance transfers must be completed within four months of account opening and incur a 3% fee (min $5) of the amount transferred. After the promotion expires, the interest rate reverts to a variable APR ranging from 14.74% to 24.74%, depending on your creditworthiness. The card does not charge an annual fee.

Frequently Asked Questions What Is the Best Credit Card? The best credit card for you depends on your goals, budget, and spending habits. As your money story evolves, the best credit card for you may also change. While credit card rewards can be valuable, if you’re focused on paying off debt, they may not be the best choice for you at this time. A card that offers a 0% APR promotion for balance transfers may be the better option until you can pay off your debt. The most appealing credit cards may not, however, be the best one you can actually get right now. People with low credit scores may be able to qualify only for cards that carry higher interest rates and fewer rewards. Those consumers should focus on building their credit until they are eligible for the credit card they desire. People with excellent credit generally have their choice of travel and other rewards credit cards. Credit cards focused on those with the best credit scores typically provide the most attractive benefits. These benefits can include lucrative one-time bonuses, significant ongoing rewards on your spending, and additional benefits like elite status, free checked bags, yearly free hotel nights, and airport lounge access. What Credit Card Is Best for Me? Finding the best credit card entails both self-consideration and research. You must document your creditworthiness and spending habits, along with reflecting on how you may use the card, whether to build credit, temporarily borrow, or simply employ it as a purchasing convenience and a way to earn rewards. If you are new to credit or have impaired credit, a secured credit card can be a great option. This type of card requires a security deposit but has the advantage that activity with the card is reported to all three credit bureaus, which helps the cardholder build credit over time. Many secured cards offer an option to graduate to a non-secured card after a period of on-time payments. Those who are carrying a card balance should consider shifting the debt to a balance transfer card with much lower interest, or even no interest rate at all for a period. These cards provide relief in the form of an extended period of a 0% APR on the transfer, which allows you to pay down the balance more easily. While some balance transfer cards offer rewards as well, it’s best to not add to your balance on the card (or, preferably, any other card) until you have paid off the amount you’ve transferred. If you frequently carry a credit card balance, you should avoid cards with high fees and interest regardless of attractive rewards and one-time bonuses. Your priority should be paying down your debt and avoiding accumulating more, not trying to earn rewards. People who tend to pay off their card balance each month should consider getting a rewards card that offers cash back or points rewards. These cards allow you to leverage your everyday spending to earn hundreds of dollars worth of rewards, usually with no annual fee. For frequent travelers, a general travel card or one issued in partnership with airlines or hotels can make the most sense. These allow you to leverage spending on travel and in other categories to earn rewards that can be used to obtain further travel. Entrepreneurs and small-business owners can choose among a host of business credit cards designed for their needs. These cards may reward business spending in certain categories, like shipping, or with specific business-related merchants, such as office supply stores. College students generally don’t have a credit history, but they do represent a good long-term customer for card issuers. Cards designed for students can provide online resources to instruct new cardmembers on the responsible use of credit and other tips to guide personal finances. What Credit Scores Are Required? The higher your credit score, the more credit cards you potentially have available to you, and the better those cards will tend to be in terms of interest rates, credit lines, and rewards programs. To understand your card choices, it’s important to know the broad range into which your credit score fits. Card issuers classify scores as “Excellent” (800+), “Very Good” (740-799), “Good” (670-739), “Fair” (580-669), or “Poor” (below 580). It’s best to only apply for cards that best match the credit recommended by the issuer to reduce the chances of being declined. If you don’t know your current credit score, it’s available in a number of ways, and at no cost. There are two main credit score types, FICO and VantageScore, both of which have their own distinct scoring algorithms and score ranges that are used by various lenders. Other factors beyond credit score are considered by card issuers in evaluating creditworthiness, including employment status, income, and other credit and deposit accounts you own. Is It Possible to Qualify for a Credit Card With Bad Credit? There are credit cards designed for those whose credit is fair, poor, and even very poor or bad. In particular, a secured credit card allows those with bad credit or no credit history to build or rebuild their score. Until they’ve completed that process, they must retain the use of the card through a security deposit that usually serves as the maximum credit line for the account. What Types of Rewards Do Credit Cards Offer? Credit card rewards come in a variety of forms, allowing cardholders to earn cash back, points, or miles for each dollar of spending. The earnings rates for rewards often vary by purchase type, with higher rewards available for certain categories of purchases. Cash back rewards are the most straightforward type and usually rebate a percentage of spending in the form of a check or statement credit. Rewards based on points or miles offer greater flexibility in how they are redeemed, whether as travel, gift cards, merchandise, or more. Travel rewards credit cards may be general in type, earning points that can be redeemed for travel on any airline or hotel, or partner-specific and co-branded with a particular airline or hotel. Co-branded cards provide less flexibility in redeeming rewards but potentially more value, provided you’re comfortable favoring a particular brand of airline or hotel chain. What Are Common Credit Card Benefits? While issuers may prominently tout certain features of their cards, other benefits tend to be buried in cards’ fine print—including some you might not realize the card even offers. Here’s a quick list of benefits that are commonly offered with a range of card types: Common Rewards Card Benefits: $0 fraud liability Primary or secondary auto-rental collision damage waiver coverage Roadside assistance hotline Price match Purchase coverage if items are stolen or damaged Extended warranties Refunds in cases of merchant dispute Common Travel Rewards Card Benefits: Trip cancellation/interruption/delay coverage Travel accident insurance Lost/delayed luggage coverage Premium Card Benefits: Airport lounge access TSA precheck/Global Reentry Fee Reimbursement every four years Cell phone insurance coverage Concierge service Methodology We constantly monitor credit card offers from card-issuer websites and publicly available sources to find the best credit cards for our readers. Each credit card is evaluated based on its fees, rewards, welcome bonuses, introductory offers, features, and benefits so that we can determine a winner for each category.

To find the best personal loan it's important to understand that there are many reasons you might need to borrow money. Whether you want to consolidate your debt, take care of an unexpected expense, or finance a home improvement project, a personal loan could be a good fit to help you access the money you need. Before you sign on the dotted line, it's smart to do a little research. Comparing loan options in advance could potentially save you money and protect your credit from unnecessary hard inquiries, which can lower your credit score. It's not uncommon for companies that offer personal loans to do what are known as soft pulls, which don't ding your credit, so you can see if you qualify before filling out an official loan application. Of course, there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all personal loan. The federal reserve reported the 24-month average personal loan interest rate at 9.65% in Q4 2020. Yet current interest rates on personal loans can range from around 2.49% to 36%, based on your credit. Plus, some lenders may not let you borrow as much money as you need. We've researched more than two dozen personal loan options and compared their interest rates, fees, qualification requirements, and other features. Below you'll find a list of our top picks for a number of categories. One overall positive: None of them charge a prepayment penalty if you happen to pay off your loan early. Depending upon your situation and why you need to borrow money, one of these personal loans might be a good fit for you.

FAQs What Is a Personal Loan? A personal loan is a predetermined amount of money given to an individual by a bank or private lender. It is usually unsecured and carries a fixed interest rate. The borrower must agree to the loan rate and terms and make on-time monthly payments until it is fully paid back. A personal loan can be used for a number of things including paying off or consolidating debt, paying medical expenses, or making a large purchase. How Do Personal Loans Work? Personal loans work by lending a borrower money if they meet certain qualifications that are set by the lender. The money is paid back over time with interest. The borrower usually makes monthly payments of principal and interest to repay the loan. A personal loan is often a more affordable option than a credit card because the interest rate is usually lower. What Are the Qualification Requirements for a Personal Loan? Qualification requirements for a personal loan vary based on the loan amount, who is lending the money, and the type of loan.

Some of the fees associated with personal loans are origination fees, prepayment penalties, late fees, and administrative fees. However, not all lenders charge the same fees. It’s important to check with the lender before getting a personal loan. Despite what fees the lender charges, the largest cost is going to be what you’re paying in interest. The average interest rate for a personal loan is 9.65%. How We Chose the Best Personal Loans There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of personal loans available. We researched and reviewed dozens of them before deciding on our top contenders. We chose these specific personal loans as the best personal loans based on the loan amount, loan term, associated fees, interest rate, and application process.

According to the College Board, in 2020–2021, the average cost of tuition and fees at a public university for an in-state student was $10,560. The cost jumped to $37,650 for a private school. Federal aid may not be enough to cover the total cost of attendance. In that situation, taking out private student loans can help fill the gap. But which lenders offer the lowest rates and the most robust benefits? We've compiled a list of the best private student loan lenders available today to help you find the best option for you. Best Student Loans of April 2021 Best Student Loan Marketplace: Credible Best Overall: Rhode Island Student Loan Authority Best Interest Rate: College Ave Best Student Loan Consolidation: Splash Financial Best Parent Student Loan: College Ave Best for International Students: MPOWER Financing Best for Students Without a Cosigner: Funding U It's best to exhaust all of your federal student loan options before even considering private student loans. Rates for federal loans issued between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, are just 2.75% for undergraduate Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans. Best Student Loans Expand Best Student Loans Credible Rhode Island Student Loan Authority College Ave Splash Financial College Ave MPOWER Financing Funding U FAQs Methodology Best Student Loan Marketplace : Credible Learn More Before applying for a student loan, it's smart to compare rates from several different lenders to ensure you get the best interest rate and loan terms. Instead of doing this process on your own, which can be frustrating and time-consuming, you can use a student loan marketplace to speed things up. With Credible, you fill out a simple form and get rate quotes from multiple student loan lenders within minutes. Getting a quote doesn't affect your credit score, and you can view multiple repayment options. Once you find a loan that works for you, you and your cosigner (if applicable) can complete the loan application online. Using Credible is completely free. Credible gets a referral fee when you apply for a loan through a lender on its marketplace. Credible doesn't include all private student loan lenders available, but it does have a range of top lenders, including Ascent, Citizens Bank, and College Ave. Read the full review: Credible Student Loans Best Overall : Rhode Island Student Loan Authority Learn More When looking for an undergraduate student loan, it's important to pay attention to interest rates, loan terms, and lender perks that can improve your borrower experience. With those factors in mind, the Rhode Island Student Loan Authority (RISLA) stands apart as the best overall lender. Despite its name, residents from any state can qualify for a RISLA loan. However, applicants who live, work, or attend college in Rhode Island may be able to get a lower interest rate than other borrowers. Loan Amounts Applicants can borrow $1,500 to $45,000 per year to pay for their undergraduate degrees. There are no application, origination, or prepayment penalties. Interest Rates Unlike some other lenders, RISLA only offers fixed-rate loans. However, these loans have fairly low interest rates. The interest rate on a loan with Student Immediate Repay is 3.99%, while a Student Deferred Repay loan has a rate of 5.24% (both include an autopay discount). Repayment Options As an undergraduate borrower, you have 2 repayment options: Student Immediate Repay: With this option, you begin making payments 15 days after the final loan disbursement. You'll repay the loan over a period of 2 years, and you'll get the lowest possible interest rate. Student Deferred Repay: If you opt for Student Deferred Repay, you'll get a higher interest rate. However, you won't have to start making payments until 6 months after you leave school, and you'll have 3 years to repay your loan. Extra Perks While RISLA offers low interest rates and a variety of repayment plans, what really sets the lender apart is the benefits it provides borrowers: Income-Based Repayment: If you're facing a financial hardship and can't afford your payments, you may qualify for RISLA's Income-Based Repayment Plan. With this approach, your repayment term is extended to up to 25 years, and your payments are based on your income and family size. Nursing Reward Program: Rhode Island resident or students attending eligible schools in Rhode Island may be eligible for the Nursing Reward Program. Under this program, RISLA will lower the interest rates on the loans of qualifying borrowers to 0% for 48 months. Loan Forgiveness for Interns: Students who complete an eligible internship can receive up to $2,000 in student loan forgiveness. Autopay Discount: Sign up for automatic payments and receive a 0.25% discount on your interest rate. Forbearance: In some cases, you may be able to temporarily postpone your payments if dealing with financial issues. Multi-year approval: Some borrowers will qualify for RISLA's multi-year program. As long as your information and your cosigner's income, credit score, and other key information remain consistent or improve, you can qualify for additional loans without having to submit another application. RISLA provides families with information on how to find financial aid, including federal loans, grants, and scholarships. It also has programs that reward students for completing internships, helping them prepare for careers after graduation. Read the full review: RISLA Student Loans Best Interest Rate : College Ave Learn More When you’re applying for a student loan, you can often choose between variable and fixed interest rates. While fixed-rate loans have the same interest rate for the duration of the repayment term, the interest rate on variable-rate loans can fluctuate over time. If you want to pay off your debt quickly, opting for a variable-rate loan can allow you to take advantage of the lower initial rate. College Ave offers some of the lowest rates on undergraduate student loans: Variable Rate: As low as 1.04% (including 0.25% autopay discount) Fixed Rate: As low as 3.34% (including 0.25% autopay discount). With College Ave, you can borrow up to the total cost of attendance (COA). There are 4 different repayment options to choose from, along with 4 different term lengths, and you can defer your payments until after graduation or opt to make in-school payments. College Ave offers the following repayment options: Full Principal and Interest Payment: Start repaying principal plus interest right away to save the most over the life of your loan Interest-Only Payment: Make payments to cover the interest only while in school Flat Payment: Make $25 payments while in school to reduce accrued interest Deferred Payment: Pay nothing while in school, but interest will still accrue Read the full review: College Ave Student Loans Best Student Loan Consolidation : Splash Financial Learn More Private student loan consolidation, also known as student loan refinancing, can be a smart way to lower your interest rate and save money over the life of your loan. Splash Financial is our pick for top student loan refinancing company. There’s a few different factors that impacted our decision: Interest rates: Splash Financial offers very low interest rates: variable rates as low as 1.89% and fixed rates as low as 2.63% (both include 0.25% autopay discount). Repayment terms: Splash Finance has multiple repayment terms, so you can choose a loan length and monthly payment that works for your budget. Depending on your needs, you can choose a loan term of 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, or 20 years. Cosigner release: Typically, Splash borrowers can request a cosigner release after making 12 consecutive monthly payments on time. The minimum refinance loan amount is $5,000. There is no maximum loan amount—it will depend on the specific lending partner that refinances your loans and other factors in your loan application. In order to refinance through Splash Financial, you must have obtained a 4-year degree from a Title IV accredited institution or an associate degree in an eligible field. Read the full review: Splash Financial Student Loan Refinancing Best Parent Student Loan : College Ave Learn More As a parent, you want what's best for your child. And that may mean helping them pay for their education by taking out a parent student loan. College Ave offers 11 different repayment terms for parent student loans, ranging from 5 to 15 years in length. That flexibility allows you to choose the loan term that works best for your budget. College Ave allows parents to borrow between $1,000 and the total COA. As an added perk, the lender allows you to get up to $2,500 of the loan delivered directly to you, so you can manage the purchasing of items such as books, dorm supplies, and a new computer for your student. The lender also has low interest rates, with variable rates as low as 1.04%, and fixed rates as low as 3.34% (lowest rates include an autopay discount). College Ave has three different repayment plans, so you can decide which is best for you: Interest-Only Payment: While your child is in school, pay only the interest charges each month. Interest Plus Payment: Pay the monthly interest charges plus whatever extra amount you decide to put toward principal each month while your child is in school. Full Principal and Interest Payment: Start repaying the full payment—including both principal and interest—immediately once the loan has been disbursed. Read the full review: College Ave Student Loans Best for International Students : MPOWER Financing Learn More Unfortunately, international students often struggle to find private student loans to pay for school, especially if they don’t have access to a cosigner who is a U.S. citizen. For those students, MPOWER Financing is the best lender. MPOWER Financing offers undergraduate and graduate student loans to international students as well as U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) students attending 350 approved colleges and universities in the U.S. and Canada. MPOWER Financing doesn’t require applicants to have a cosigner, an established credit history, or collateral. For international undergraduate students, you can borrow $2,001 to $25,000, with a $50,000 lifetime borrowing limit. The undergrad APR is 14.98% (12.94% for grad students), but you can qualify for up to 1.5% in rate discounts, including: 0.50% automatic payment discount 0.50% on-time payment discount 0.50% graduation and employment discount Both graduate and undergraduate loans require interest-only payments while you’re in school and during your 6-month grace period following graduation, and both have a 10-year repayment term. Read the full review: MPOWER Financing Student Loans Best for Students Without a Cosigner : Funding U Learn More As a college student who may not have an established credit history or any income, you can struggle to qualify for a private student loan on your own. If you don't have a parent or relative to act as a cosigner, finding a lender who will approve your loan application can be difficult. For those who don't have access to a cosigner, Funding U may be the best option. Unlike some other lenders who offer non-cosigned loans to only college juniors and seniors, Funding U allows undergraduate students of all grade levels to qualify for a loan. You must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident who is over the age of 18 and enrolled in a 4-year degree program at an eligible 4-year college. You can borrow $3,000 to $10,000 per year. Your eligibility for a loan is based on your GPA (minimum varies by grade level), extracurricular activities, and work experience. The fixed interest rate on undergraduate student loans for the 2020-21 school year is 7.99% to 14.49%, which includes a 0.5% autopay discount. You can make either $20 minimum payments or interest-only payments each month you're in school for up to 51 months. Loan repayment (principal plus interest) begins 6 months after graduation. Unfortunately, Funding U only lends to residents of certain states. You must live in one of the following states to qualify for a loan: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. FAQs How Do Student Loans Work? Student loans are money borrowed from the government or a private lender to pay for college. The loan has to be paid back after graduation, along with the interest that has been accrued. The loan can usually be used to cover tuition, room and board, books and other school related expenses. Student loans are different from scholarships and grants which don’t have to be paid back. You can apply for a student loan online and fill out your (and your parent’s, if applicable) financial information. Student loan qualifications are different depending on the type of loan you receive but can include FICO score and income. Typically, you will need multiple student loans to cover your entire tuition and all related expenses. A financial aid counselor from your high school or your future college should be able to help you better navigate the process. What are Some Alternatives to Student Loans? If you decide that a student loan isn’t for you or want to know what other options you have, there are some alternatives: Parents pay for college Merit-based scholarship Athletic scholarship Work-study aid Savings or an inheritance Grants What are the Different Types of Student Loans? Typically, student loans fall into 2 major categories: federal and private. Private loans are also called alternative loans. Federal student loans: There are multiple types of federal loans but, in general, they have lower interest rates and better repayment terms than private loans. They’re also more readily available and may be easier to obtain than a private loan. They have fixed interest rates and some options aren’t dependent on your credit history. Private student loans: These should be looked into after federal student loans are exhausted. Private student loans may cover continuing education without a degree, tuition for non U.S. citizens, and for education costs incurred after graduation. How Much Do Student Loans Cost? The main cost associated with student loans is the interest. However, some loans may also charge origination fees, prepayment penalties, and late fees. Federal loans tend to have lower interest rates so it’s best to apply for them first. Currently, the interest rate on federal student loans for undergraduates is 2.75%. Are Student Loans Worth the Cost? Student loans can be expensive, with application fees and making monthly principal and interest payments. They can get especially expensive if you choose to go to grad, medical or law school in addition to a 4-year college. If you have an alternative way to pay for college, then it’s great to explore that first. Otherwise, student loans are generally worth the cost because you’re investing in yourself and your education, which should help you land a higher paying job or acquire the knowledge and skills to start your own business. How We Chose the Best Student Loans There are so many federal and private student loans to choose from. We reviewed dozens of student loans and chose the best student loans based on their interest rates, types of loans offered, cosigner requirements, loan consolidation options, and the overall application process. Methodology Research for this article encompassed private student loan lenders of undergraduate private student loans (as well as companies that refinance student loans) narrowed down from national banks, credit unions, and lenders. The criteria for measuring each lender included all available APR ranges for these loans, fees charged, repayment plans and hardship options offered, and the inclusion of additional features such as cosigner release, parent loan availability, and a refinance option. Ultimately, the ""best of"" awarded the highest status to the lenders that are available nationwide that offered the lowest fixed APRs, the most comprehensive hardship programs, and the least number of fees.

Life insurance is a financial product you purchase in order to protect your family against the financial consequences of your death. Life insurance coverage intends to provide money to replace your wages in the event of your untimely death, and many consumers buy enough coverage to pay for debts like a mortgage or to cover college expenses for their children. While people who purchase life insurance hope they never need it, this kind of coverage is crucial for consumers who want to sleep well at night without worrying about what might happen to their family if they pass away. Life insurance is also an integral part of the average person’s comprehensive financial plan, and this is especially true for families who have children to care for. Term Life Insurance vs. Permanent Life Insurance Term life insurance is sold for a particular term, usually in 10-, 20-, and 30-year increments. Once that term expires, the policyholder will have to apply again for a new policy. Premiums for term life insurance are almost always less expensive than permanent life insurance. Permanent life insurance provides coverage for the policyholder’s entire life. There are two types of permanent life insurance: whole and universal. Unlike term life, permanent life insurance offers a savings benefit to the owner, known as the cash value of the policy. The cash value can be borrowed or withdrawn from the policy. How to Find the Best Life Insurance Policy The best type of life insurance is the one that fits you and your family. Term life policies can be very affordable compared to whole life insurance. For example, a 30-year-old man with a 20-year $500,000 policy will pay an average of $27 a month.﻿﻿ A 30-year-old man with a $100,000 whole life policy will pay $82.06 a month. This is more than double the cost of term life while providing less coverage.﻿﻿ To get the best life insurance policy for your situation, and one that fits your budget, we advise following these steps: Step 1: Decide what kind of policy you want, term or permanent. Step 2: Figure out how much you need and how long of a term you need if you’re buying a term policy. You may want to talk to a financial planner about what makes sense for you and your family. Step 3: Talk to a life insurance broker and ask them to pull quotes for the type of life insurance you’re interested in. If you're not sure whether to choose term or permanent life insurance, ask the broker to get quotes for both kinds. Step 4: Compare quotes from different providers and choose one that meets your requirements and fits your budget. Step 5: Schedule a medical exam if necessary. If not, apply for and wait to be approved for the policy. What Does Life Insurance Typically Cover? Life insurance is purchased on an individual, so it pays out a death benefit if that person passes away. Since term life insurance is offered in a specific amount for a specific term, the death benefit is the main component of a basic term life insurance policy. However, some life insurance policies also build cash value over time. This cash value can serve as a savings account or as collateral the insured can borrow against. Note, however, that the cash value you accrue with some policies is a living benefit, meaning it goes back to the insurance company when you die. Many life insurance companies have additional riders added on that can provide more coverage. Common riders include accidental death riders that pay out more if you die in an accident or the waiver of premium rider that comes into play if the insured becomes unable to work and pay their premiums. Another rider, the accelerated death benefit rider, allows the insured to collect a portion of their death benefit before they pass away upon diagnosis of a terminal illness. What Does Life Insurance Typically Exclude? During a recent interview with Andrew Mais, commissioner of the Connecticut Insurance Department, he remarked that ""Policies tend to have certain exclusions. So if I go skydiving, for instance, it may not cover me for that."" There's a handful of exclusions that can come into play when you purchase life insurance. For example, you may be denied a payout on a policy if the insured commits suicide or dies within two years of the policy coming into force. Also, your policy may not pay out if you lie or purposely mislead the insurer on your health questionnaire. What Are the Expected Costs of Life Insurance? Life insurance costs can vary widely depending on the type of policy you purchase, the amount of coverage you buy, your age, your gender, your weight, whether or not you smoke or have smoked in the past, and your overall health. Some insurance providers also ask customers to complete a medical exam to qualify. If you plan to buy a term policy and you’re age 30, you might pay as little as $12 per month for a policy worth $250,000 that lasts 20 years. If you’re 50 and want that much coverage, on the other hand, you can expect to pay closer to $35 per month or more. However, permanent life insurance coverage is always more expensive than term life insurance coverage. The good news is that most companies make it easy to get a free, no-obligation quote for life insurance online. If you’re curious about how much you might pay for a policy, you should submit your information to find out. Is Paying for Life Insurance Worth It? If you want basic life insurance coverage that will replace your income for a specific term if you pass away, then it’s hard to argue against term life insurance. Premiums for term coverage tend to be inexpensive for consumers who are in good or excellent health, and you can gain peace of mind when you have a policy in place. However, you may benefit from permanent life insurance if you have a more complicated financial situation, or if you have a certain level of wealth to protect. If you’re curious about which type of life insurance would serve you better, it may be wise to set up an appointment with a life insurance agent to go over the pros and cons of different types of coverage. Either way, a basic level of life insurance coverage is usually worth the monthly premiums you’ll pay. You can pay more if you want a generous death benefit or an extremely long term, but anyone can benefit from some basic coverage to help care for dependents and cover final expenses. How We Chose the Best Life Insurance Companies Our life insurance methodology is comprehensive. In order to compile our list of the best life insurance companies, we researched and evaluated more than two dozen different life insurance companies. We gathered data (both qualitative and quantitative) about each company, including ratings for financial strength (using independent ratings from companies like AM Best), customer satisfaction scores (using J.D. Power ratings, BBB complaints, and independent customer reviews), as well as pricing and customer experience. Our review process gave preference to companies that offered online quoting tools and transparent pricing. We also looked at the functionality, such as online forms and customer portals, offered by carriers for customers to manage their policies and file claims online. Companies that offered multiple forms of customer service, such as phone, email, and live chat through their websites, also received ratings boosts. Lastly, we looked at the individual offerings available—types of policies and riders offered, as well as additional products and services, such as investment options—from each of the companies we reviewed and assessed the relative strengths of each. Of the companies we considered, those that offered numerous types of policies (e.g., term, whole, universal), riders (e.g., living benefits, waiver of premium, return of premium), and other services were given higher ratings, as we believe these companies are better positioned to help individual customers find the life insurance coverage they need.

Well, for one thing, it's mandated in just about every state in the union (and the two that currently don't require insurance, New Hampshire and Virginia, deem you responsible for covering any bodily injury or property damage caused by a car you own). Like many other types of insurance, even if it wasn't required by law, the peace of mind that car insurance coverage provides spans from sea to shining sea. However, not all car insurance policies are the same, and each car insurance company offers something unique to its customers. When comparing providers, it’s important to look at the entire picture, including customer service, coverage options, discount offerings, and even the digital experience the company’s website offers. We considered all of those factors (and more) while also analyzing ratings from agencies like J.D. Power and publications like U.S. News & World Report to compile a list of the best auto insurers in the industry. Based on our findings, here are a quintet of companies that we feel represent the best in the industry for rates and discount offerings, military families, personalized experiences, claims satisfaction, and high-risk drivers. We selected the following as the six best car insurance companies. Below you'll find auto insurance offers available from our advertising partners, followed by our complete in-depth list of the best car insurance companies we've found.

Read the full review: GEICO Car Insurance Best Personalized Experience : State Farm State Farm Learn More Over the past century, State Farm has grown into a national name for a variety of insurance products, including car coverage. And—increasingly rare in this digitized, outsourcing age—it maintains a network of employees across the United States, meaning you always have access to a local State Farm agent for your insurance questions and needs. Coverage & Discount Options State Farm offers fairly extensive car insurance coverages like: Liability coverage Collision and comprehensive Medical payments & Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage Uninsured & underinsured motorist coverage GAP insurance Rideshare insurance Emergency roadside assistance Rental car & travel expense reimbursement Additionally, State Farm offers coverage for other vehicles, like motorcycles, boats, and off-road vehicles. You can bundle your auto coverage with one of its other insurance policies. When it comes to discounts, State Farm offers lots of options for safe drivers, safe vehicles, and customer loyalty. Bundling different insurance policies can save up to 17%, and multi-vehicle policies, up to 20%. Digital Experience In comparison to some of the other top insurance companies, State Farm is a bit behind when it comes to a streamlined digital experience. What that being said, State Farm started a partnership with SalesForce back in 2018 to enhance the online experience for its customers. Like most other insurance websites, you can now manage your account through the State Farm customer portal. Customer Satisfaction State Farm holds numerous awards and accolades for its customer service. J.D. Power's 2020 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study ranked State Farm sixth out of 25 insurance companies.﻿﻿ Of course, what makes State Farm stand out are those local service agents, who get high marks for being efficient, knowledgable, and easy to reach (no dialing a 1-800 number, and enduring endless prompts and sitting on hold). Our Verdict on State Farm ﻿Although State Farm doesn’t offer as many digital perks as some other large insurance companies, the company does offer an extensive network of agents to help with your insurance needs anytime. Furthermore, State Farm is one of the oldest insurance companies in the industry and has a great track record with customers. Read the full review: State Farm Car Insurance Best Claims Satisfaction : Amica Mutual Learn More Amica Mutual has received the top spot on J.D. Power’s Auto Claims Satisfaction Study multiple times. It earned second top spot in 2020.﻿﻿ From low complaints to low premiums, it garners superlatives in several areas. We're singling it out as the best based on claims satisfaction. Coverage & Discount Options Like most other auto insurance companies, Amica offers all of the required and beneficial elective coverages you’d need: 24/7 roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement, and even glass coverage (repairing your windshield or windows, without incurring a deductible). Amica also offers an inclusive package called Platinum Choice Auto, which includes perks like accident forgiveness, the aforementioned glass coverage, identity theft monitoring, and premium rental car coverage. Customers can also receive referral and loyalty discounts. Amica's rates are competitive.

Still, they are easy to navigate, and you can do the standard tasks, like pay bills or access ID cards. Amica also allows its customers to file claims through the app and online. Customers can also request roadside assistance through the app. Customer Satisfaction Amica’s customer reviews are overwhelmingly positive. Furthermore, the company holds a complaint rating of 0.58 with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which is one of the lowest in the industry.﻿﻿ Customers say that Amica handles claims quickly and efficiently and that customer service representatives are always available to answer questions. Our Verdict on Amica While Amica Mutual doesn’t offer any unique discounts or digital bells and whistles, their reputation for customer service and claims satisfaction speaks for itself. And their premiums aren't out of line; in fact, they rank among the lowest in the business. We highly recommend this company if you’re looking for a reliable vendor when it comes time to make a claim. Read the full review: Amica Car Insurance Best For Military Families : USAA USAA Learn More If you or a family member has or has had military ties, then the car coverage offered by USAA is hands down your best choice.

Our Verdict on USAA If you meet the criteria for USAA’s car insurance coverage, then you should definitely take advantage of it. The company offers great rates, impressive discounts for current members of the military, and a wonderful online experience. Read the full review: USAA Car Insurance Best For High-Risk Drivers : Progressive Learn More If your driving record is less than stellar, Progressive can help you avoid the financial burden of your driving record. In fact, Progressive's Name Your Price Tool allows you to opt in for a coverage plan that meets your state's minimum coverage requirements while also fitting your budget. Also, you can redeem your driving record and save even more through Progressive's Snapshot program. This is why many high-risk drivers choose Progressive over other car insurance companies. Coverage When it comes to auto coverage, Progressive offers: Bodily injury liability Property damage liability Collision and comprehensive coverage Uninsured motorist coverage Personal injury protection and medical payments GAP coverage Umbrella insurance policies What’s more, Progressive offers some unique items, such as rideshare coverage for Lyft and Uber drivers, classic car coverage for antique autos, Mexican travel insurance for those who drive across the border, and custom parts coverage for aftermarket equipment. For those who want to switch all of their insurance policies over to Progressive, the company also offers homeowner's and other property coverage, plus life insurance and other personal policies. Discounts Progressive’s Snapshot program personalizes your rate based on your actual driving habits, which can not only help good drivers save money, but it can help drivers with a record lower their premiums over time. Progressive offers an average discount of nearly $37 off your first policy period just for signing up for the Snapshot program, and most drivers save an average of $145 every six months with the Snapshot program. If you’re looking for more ways to save money, Progressive also offers: Online discounts for those who obtain quotes and enroll in policies online Multi-car and multiple-policy discounts for customers who bundle policies Teen driver discounts for drivers under 18, as well as student discounts for high school and college students with good grades Automatic payment discounts for policyholders who use automatic payments Paperless discounts for policyholders who go paperless Paid-in-full discount for customers who pay their full premium instead of monthly installments Loyalty discounts for those who renew policies or add additional policies down the line Digital Experience Progressive actually offers one of the best digital experiences out of all the major insurance companies across the nation, with a variety of features like the Name Your Price Tool and Comparison Tool, which lets you compare rates side by side when shopping for a policy. What's more, Progressive's app (available both through the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store) allows you to manage your policy from anywhere. With the app, you can obtain 24/7 roadside assistance and file a claim, make payments or policy changes, and even obtain a digital ID card to provide proof of insurance. However, you currently cannot manage your homeowner's policy through the app, so those with multiple policies may also want to use the online portal through Progressive's website when making policy changes. Customer Satisfaction While the perks of Progressive seem endless, not all customers feel the same way. In its 2020 Claims Satisfaction Survey,﻿﻿ J.D. Power rated Progressive in the bottom half (21st out of 24) of insurers, which implies policyholders are less than thrilled with the payouts on their claims. The BBB gives Progressive an A+ rating, yet the company only holds a one-star average from customer reviews.﻿﻿ As we looked through BBB complaint logs, it appears that most complaints center around claims processing and accident fault decisions. This likely explains why J.D. Power issued the rating it did. Our Verdict on Progressive Overall, Progressive really shines in its discount offerings and willingness to accept high-risk drivers. Because of this, we highly recommend Progressive for any driver with a history of accidents or any other negatives on their driving record. In fact, we suggest you enroll in the Snapshot program and let your current record help reduce the rates that your past may currently influence.

Power's 2020 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study﻿﻿ and second of 12 companies in the 2020 Insurance Shopping Study.﻿﻿ Furthermore, Erie Insurance maintains an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau.﻿﻿ Our Verdict on Erie Insurance Erie Insurance has an excellent reputation in the insurance industry and a longstanding history of continued stability.

With some exceptions, most car insurance companies offer the following types of coverage: Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability, which pays for the other party's medical care and property damage if you’re found at fault in an auto accident. Collision Coverage, which pays for damage to your own car regardless of fault. Comprehensive Coverage, which pays for damage to your car in the event of weather damage or theft. Personal Injury Protection/Medical Payments, which covers your own medical expenses regardless of fault. Uninsured Motorist Coverage, which pays for your own medical and car repair bills if you are in an accident with an uninsured driver. Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) Coverage, which covers the gap between what is owed on your car's lease or loan and its current value if the accident caused a total loss. What Coverage Do I Even Need? Many drivers go by the minimum coverage amounts set by their state's regulations because it seems like the most affordable option. However, it’s important to understand what precisely what is included in each policy, before selecting which coverages to add and which to leave off. In a recent interview with Douglas Heller, an auto insurance expert and consumer advocate, he explained that, ""There's one additional type of coverage that is required—not by the government, but by your car lender. It's called comprehensive and collision coverage. If you don't own your car outright, say you have a loan, or are leasing your vehicle, the company financing the car, whether it's a bank, finance company, or lease company, will require comprehensive and collision."" What Should I Do When Comparing Car Insurance Companies? When comparing insurance rates between multiple insurance companies, it’s important to keep several considerations in mind, including the actual coverage you’re receiving (including dollar amounts for each coverage), available discounts, the company’s financial strength rating, and the company’s customer service ratings. Make sure you understand everything about how car insurance works before making your final decision. When choosing a car insurance company, consider your needs and prioritize your choice based on what is most important to you. While GEICO offers the lowest rates across the board, other companies like Amica offer the best claims satisfaction, Progressive offers great coverage for high-risk drivers, State Farm offers the most personalized experience, and USAA gives amazing discounts to military personnel. How We Chose the Best Car Insurance Companies ﻿When determining our top car insurance choices, we evaluated each insurance company based on several categories, including: financial strength via A.M. Best, claims satisfaction ratings based on J.D. Power’s latest Claims Satisfaction Survey, and customer reviews from websites such as the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Reports, and more. We also complied comparison data from multiple consumer review websites. Our analysis is an excellent guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare quotes before committing to a single car insurance provider.

That reach is measured by the impact and quality of the advisor's published work, public appearances, online following, and commitment to financial literacy across diverse communities. The 2020 Investopedia 100 also heavily weighed peer-to-peer nominations, highlighting the most influential advisors who were recommended by their peers.

https://psiloveyou.xyz/dating-while-black-6ed4f4118794?source=topic_page---------4------------------1----------,"Dating While Black. and Why I’m Crying on a Second Date | by Ambra Jordan | Apr, 2021 | P.S. I Love You","Sign in Felicia C. Sullivan Andrew Knott Jessica Wildfire Michael Thompson Fiction About Submit Dating While Black and Why I’m Crying on a Second Date Ambra Jordan Follow Apr 20 · 6 min read Photo by Jasmine Carter on Pexels I warned him that if we approached the subject of existing while Black in any capacity, it would result in an onslaught of tears. I can’t help but be sensitive to the topic of having to navigate predominantly white spaces while being acutely aware that our existence makes people uncomfortable. I wasn’t prepared for this conversation, but I could sense that my date had a bit to get off his chest. In a world where self-expression is an act of resistance, who was I to silence him? There’s something oddly comforting about being able to discuss shared trauma and conditioning — hearing that he, too, feels a trickle of panic travel up his spine at the sound of sirens coming from his music made me chuckle but it also made me sad. I think that fear response was passed at birth. I wiped the tears from my face, careful not to ruin my makeup, as he talked about being a Black chameleon, having to adapt to his environment after reading a room to ensure his safety. At the end of the day, he just wants to survive. That resonated with me because as a woman, same. But that’s a topic for another day. I sat quietly and listened for a bit as he went on about having an action plan in case he ever got pulled over, knowing exactly what to do and say, having all his documents readily available on the dashboard, hands on the wheel, memorizing phone numbers and knowing who to call depending on the situation, and on and on. What a luxury it must be to grow up in a version of America where you have the privilege of believing that the police are there to protect you. The decision to have children is already a heavy decision for anyone, but to raise Black children knowing that they could be the next Daunte Wright, or Trayvon Martin, or Sandra Bland, is a weight almost unbearable to hold. Once, I called 911 for a medical emergency, I wondered whether the dispatcher would only send medical help or if the police would be dispatched as well. And I wondered how they’d treat my drunk, elderly, confused, Black dad if they showed up. That line of thinking was almost enough for me not to seek help at all, but I digress. We showed up at the restaurant about the same time; I’ll admit I was a little late. When I caught his eyes, a flutter of excitement flashed across my face. Play it cool, Ambra. His smile was just as big as mine, so I went in for a hug. I could have held on longer, but I had to remind myself that it was only date #2. The restaurant was empty, so we were greeted right away by a hostess and then a waitress who gave us a minute to check the menu before stopping by to get our order. But, as good dates tend to go, we were too wrapped up in conversation to have chosen food by that point. The first thing I noticed about my date when I saw his profile on Hinge was his smile. I describe smiling as my signature look; he calls it a special talent of his. I don’t disagree. We talked about having children (generally speaking, not with each other). He said something that I’ve been thinking for a while — that the decision to have children is already a heavy decision to make for anyone, but the decision to raise Black children knowing that they could be the next Daunte Wright, or Trayvon Martin, or Sandra Bland, is a weight that is almost unbearable to hold. For years, I told myself I wouldn’t have children, and this was the reason why. And here was my date telling me that, given that we don’t know what the world will look like in the next 5 years, perhaps having children isn’t in the cards. When your thoughts are consumed about surviving the day, how can you even think about having kids? There was something oddly comforting about knowing that I wasn’t the only one thinking it, but it also made me sad because I do want to start a family. I just wish I didn’t have to consider Blackness as a reason not to. Someone once said to me that I shouldn’t let racism rob me of my human right to bear children. But truth be told, racism robs me of a lot of things. Our conversation turned to the joys of being Black. Even Black boy joy makes me cry; it’s a breath of fresh air after being swallowed by the heaviness of Black trauma. We talked about the richness of our melanin, the power and influence of our culture, and the fact that despite how hard it is being Black, we wouldn’t have it any other way. I admitted to him that, although I deleted my social media profiles from my phone, I re-installed Instagram just to look at his photos after he made it abundantly clear that all his profiles were public. I told him about the photos and videos that made me smile and laugh, dancing with his dog, the mimosa tutorial with the pinky up, all the adventures — experienced while Black. It was all enchanting. But one of the reasons I stay off social media is because of how overwhelming it gets. One second, I’m laughing at his intro to a video, “…it’s ya boy holdin’ it down for the 99 and 2000s” (if you know, you know) and the next second I’m crying at “RIP” and a photo of a Black man. I don’t even know the story. But I do know, in a way. We talked about the richness of our melanin, the power and influence of our culture, and the fact that despite how hard it is being Black, we wouldn’t have it any other way. There’s nothing wrong with my Blackness or his Blackness, obviously. It’s everything else. It’s our childhood friends who exchanged their woke badges for police badges and lost the mental capacity to acknowledge the disparities in policing Black bodies. It’s the white-passing friends who speed past police cars without fear while their Black friends in the back shout at them to slow down so we don’t get pulled over. We did get pulled over, by the way. It’s the formulaic media portrayal of Black victims as criminals, robbing Black children of their youth, erasing our humanity and softness. There’s nothing wrong with my Blackness or his. And fortunately for me, he couldn’t have made it any clearer on our date. He was very vocal about everything he liked, including my skin. I didn’t need validation, but I really liked the attention. It was nice to see that he noticed all the little things, too — the nails, eyebrows, the white shoes. He held my hands across the table and gently caressed my forearm before toasting to our second date. That night, I wondered if he made it home safely. I don’t know about you, but anytime I leave an establishment with a Black man I always worry about them making it home safely. I always worry that they’ll be stopped for driving while Black. I worried that if he were stopped, a police officer wouldn’t see the kind, gentle, funny person that I got to experience a second date with. That instead, they’d see a 6ft tall Black man with dreads who ‘fits the description.’ Not the description of anyone in particular, but just ‘the description.’ I sent him a text letting him know I made it home. He didn’t text back for 2 hours but who’s counting? It’s not like he knew I’d be worried and anyway, in dating there are no guarantees. But the fact that he responded at all let me know two things, 1) that he indeed made it home safely and, 2) there’s a chance for a third date. After getting his text and finally feeling at ease, I reflected on the night as I dozed off to sleep. A thought crossed my mind that put a smile on my face, something I must have seen in a meme: I love being Black. Shit’s kinda dangerous but it’s lit. P.S.

He received his master's degree in financial management from the Netherlands and his Bachelor of Technology degree from India. Learn about our editorial policies Shobhit Seth Updated Mar 25, 2021 What Is 0x Protocol? The 0x protocol is an open protocol that enables the peer-to-peer exchange of assets on the Ethereum blockchain. The 0x protocol was launched in 2017. It was built by 0x Labs, an organization based in San Francisco, California that is focused on creating new markets in the 0x ecosystem. The goal of 0x Labs is to create the necessary infrastructure for the emerging cryptocurrency economy and to enable markets to be created that couldn't have existed before. The protocol itself is not a decentralized exchange but allows for the creation of decentralized exchanges that can be used in broad applications. Key Takeaways The 0x protocol is an open protocol that enables the peer-to-peer exchange of assets on the Ethereum blockchain. The 0x protocol was built by 0x Labs, an organization based in San Francisco, California that is focused on creating new markets in the 0x ecosystem. Built on the foundation of Ethereum token standards, 0x protocol acts as the key infrastructure layer for the burgeoning number of financial applications and instruments that are on-boarding the blockchain technology stack and are getting traded in digital forms. Understanding 0x Protocol In the world of digital currencies, a protocol is a set of standard rules that can be used by a system (or by various transacting parties) to smoothly communicate with each other. The 0x protocol is essentially a standard messaging format that transacting entities can use to exchange digital assets or tokens. The standard SWIFT messaging system used in the banking industry is similar to a protocol (except that it is used in a different context). Banks across the globe use the standard SWIFT messaging system to communicate with each other about money transfers. The system has a standard set of message fields that are defined for all users; their corresponding values are used in the SWIFT system to securely convey details between two parties, such as sender, recipient, amount, currency, source branch, and destination branch, among others. Because each bank has adapted to the standard rules of the SWIFT messaging system, they are able to transact with each other directly. The situation would go awry if each bank followed its own distinct protocol because each bank would then have to adhere to a one-on-one communication channel with every other bank. Following a standard and universally acceptable format allows for smoother operations with higher efficiency. The 0x protocol attempts to work similarly to SWIFT, but it works in the context of operating decentralized exchanges for trading digital tokens and assets that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Built on the foundation of Ethereum token standards, 0x protocol acts as the key infrastructure layer for the burgeoning number of financial applications and instruments that are on-boarding the blockchain technology stack and are getting traded in digital forms. As more and more of the world’s financial value is getting tokenized with every passing day, the requirement to trade such digital assets and tokens in a secure and efficient manner is growing. With its clearly defined message formats and smart contracts, the 0x protocol attempts to answer this need. It is used in a wide array of markets, such as gaming and financing, that enables users to trade tokens and assets. ZRX is 0x’s native governance and staking token. Individuals who own ZRX have a say in how the protocol evolves and token holders can also stake their tokens to earn ETH liquidity rewards. Special Considerations What Are the Components of the 0x Protocol? 0x protocol’s message format is composed of a set of data fields that carry key information, such as the digital asset or token to be traded, the price value of the transaction, the expiration time, and the defined identities of the transacting parties. The smart contracts take care of the necessary business logic responsible for generating, sending, receiving, and processing the data linked to the trading activity. It also allows room for the necessary upgrades, if any, in the future. The provisions for upgrades are necessary, in the event that there are any changes required for adhering to the modified regulations, or for any changes linked to the intrinsic working of the Ethereum blockchain network. The system also uses relayers, which act as order aggregators and are responsible for broadcasting the orders from designated market participants to the marketplace or exchange.

Article Reviewed on March 16, 2020 Learn about our Financial Review Board Amy Drury Updated Aug 17, 2020 What Is 1%/10 Net 30? The 1%/10 net 30 calculation is a way of providing cash discounts on purchases. It means that if the bill is paid within 10 days, there is a 1% discount. Otherwise, the total amount is due within 30 days. Key Takeaways A 1%/10 net 30 deal is when a 1% discount is offered for services or products as long as they are paid within 10 days of a 30-day payment agreement. The cost of credit is used as a percentage and occurs when the buyer does not take the reduced cost, thus paying the higher cost, reflecting the discount loss. A vendor may offer incentives to pay early to accelerate the inflow of cash, which is especially important for businesses with no revolving lines of credit. Understanding 1%/10 Net 30 The 1%/10 net 30 calculation represents the credit terms and payment requirements outlined by a seller. The vendor may offer incentives to pay early to accelerate the inflow of cash. This is particularly important for cash-strapped businesses or companies with no revolving lines of credit. Companies with higher profit margins are more likely to offer cash discounts. Although the numbers are always interchangeable across vendors, the standard structure for offering a payment discount is the same. The first number will always be the percentage discount. This figure will indicate the total percentage discount on the invoice prior to shipping or taxes that may be discounted upon early payment. Special Considerations Discount terms like 1%/10 net 30 are virtual short-term loans. This is because if the discount is not taken, the buyer must pay the higher price as opposed to paying a reduced cost. In effect, the difference between these two prices reflects the discount lost, which can be reported as a percentage. This percentage is called the cost of credit. When the credit terms are 1%/10 net 30, the net result becomes, in essence, an interest charge of 18.2% upon the failure to take the discount. Companies with higher profit margins are more likely to offer cash discounts. The accounting entry for a cash discount taken may be performed in two ways. The gross method of purchase discounts assumes the discount will not be taken and will only input the discount upon actual receipt of payment within the discount period. Therefore, the entire amount of receivable will be debited. When payment is received, the receivable will be credited in the amount of the payment and the difference will be a credit to discounts taken. The alternative method is called the net method. For a discount of 1%/10 net 30, it is assumed the 1% discount will be taken. This results in a receivable being debited for 99% of the total cost. Example of 1%/10 Net 30 For example, if ""$1000 - 1%/10 net 30"" is written on a bill, the buyer can take a 1% discount ($1000 x 0.01 = $10) and make a payment of $990 within 10 days, or pay the entire $1000 within 30 days. If the invoice is not paid within the discount period, no price reduction occurs, and the invoice must be paid within the stipulated number of days before late fees may be assessed. The second number is always the number of days of the discount period. In the example above, the discount period is 10 days. Finally, the third number always reflects the invoice due date.

He is a member of the Investopedia Financial Review Board and the co-author of Investing to Win. Gordon is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). He is also a member of ASTD, ISPI, STC, and MTA. Article Reviewed on March 12, 2020 Learn about our Financial Review Board Gordon Scott Updated Mar 16, 2020 What Is a 10-K? A 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly-traded company about its financial performance and is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The report contains much more detail than a company's annual report, which is sent to its shareholders before an annual meeting to elect company directors. Some of the information a company is required to document in the 10-K includes its history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and any other relevant data. The SEC requires this report to keep investors aware of a company's financial condition and to allow them to have enough information before they buy or sell shares in the corporation, or before investing in the firm’s corporate bonds. 1:28 10-K Understanding 10-Ks Because of the depth and nature of the information they contain, 10-Ks are fairly long and tend to be complicated. But investors need to understand that this is one of the most comprehensive and most important documents a public company can publish on a yearly basis. The more information they can gather from the 10-K, the more they can understand about the company. The government requires companies to publish 10-K forms so investors have fundamental information about companies so they can make informed investment decisions. This form gives a clearer picture of everything a company does and what kinds of risks it faces. Investors in the know are aware that 10-Ks can also be retrieved by using the company search function through the SEC's EDGAR database. The 10-K includes five distinct sections: Business. This provides an overview of the company’s main operations, including its products and services (i.e., how it makes money). Risk factors. These outline any and all risks the company faces or may face in the future. The risks are typically listed in order of importance. Selected financial data. This section details specific financial information about the company over the last five years. This section presents more of a near-term view of the company’s recent performance. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Also known as MD&A, this gives the company an opportunity to explain its business results from the previous fiscal year. This section is where the company can tell its story in its own words. Financial statements and supplementary data. This includes the company’s audited financial statements including the income statement, balance sheets, and statement of cash flows. A letter from the company’s independent auditor certifying the scope of their review is also included in this section. A 10-K filing also includes signed letters from the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer. In it, the executives swear under oath that the information included in the 10-K is accurate. These letters became a requirement after several high-profile cases involving accounting fraud following the dot-com bust. Where to Find a 10-K Notably, 10-K filings are public information and readily available through a number of sources. In fact, the vast majority of companies include them in the Investor Relations section of their website. The information included in a 10-K can be difficult to move through, but the more familiar investors become with the layout and the type of information included, it will likely become easier to identify the most important details. Key Takeaways A 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by public companies about their financial performance. The report is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is far more detailed than the annual report. Information in the 10-K includes corporate history, financial statements, earnings per share, and any other relevant data. The 10-K is a useful tool for investors to make important decisions about their investments. 10-K Filing Deadlines Filing deadlines for the 10-K vary based on the size of the company. According to the SEC, companies with a public float—shares issued to the public that are available to trade—of $700 million or more must file their 10-K within 60 days after the end of their fiscal year. Companies with a float between $75 million and $700 million have 75 days, while companies with less than $75 million in its float has 90 days. Forms 10-Q and 8-K Along with the 10-K, the SEC requires that public companies regularly file forms 10-Q and 8-K. Form 10-Q must be submitted to the SEC on a quarterly basis. This form is a comprehensive report of a company's performance and includes relevant information about its financial position. Unlike the 10-K, the information in the 10-Q is usually unaudited. The company is only required to file it three times a year as the 10-K is filed in the fourth quarter. The form 8-K though is required by the SEC whenever companies announce major events of which shareholders must be made aware. These events may include (but aren't limited to) sales, acquisitions, delistings, departures, and elections of executives, as well as changes in a company's status or control, bankruptcies, information about operations, assets, and any other relevant news.

A 10-K wrap is a summary report of a company's annual performance that bundles the 10-K report required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with additional commentary from the company, covering such things as the corporate vision, letter to shareholders, and business overview, among other topics. The 10-K wrap is often released instead of a traditional annual report and generally contains fewer images and comments from management. Key Takeaways A 10-K wrap is part of a larger annual performance document required by the SEC. The ""wrap"" is a short commentary covering the more personal side of the business, and usually includes a letter to the shareholders and corporate vision statement. The 10-K wrap report is shorter than a company's annual report. While a 10-K wrap (typically) has a lower-value production budget with limited graphics, its cover may be extremely polished by comparison. The basic sections of a 10-K wrap summarize the company's financial status, plus an overview of the company's financial plans for upcoming quarters. Usually, a 10-K wrap provides debt and spending level forecasts, as well. Understanding 10-K Wrap The most significant difference between the traditional annual report and the 10-K wrap is how the information is presented and how much additional information is included above the required 10-K information. The traditional annual report has a greater focus on comments from the company, and the document includes more images and graphs to communicate performance, as well as a list of corporate objectives of the company. By contrast, the 10-K wrap is essentially the 10-K filed with the SEC and some additional editorial from the company—but not nearly as much as the annual report. It usually has a lower production cost because it is often printed on lower-quality paper. The 10-K wrap is typically made available in print and digital formats to maximize access for shareholders, investors, and analysts. Elements of a 10-K Wrap The basic elements of a 10-K wrap typically include a summary of the company's financial results for the previous year and an overview of its plans for upcoming quarters, including spending and debt level forecasts. A 10-K plan can also include an elaborate cover design, with perhaps a theme that focuses on investors and analysts involved in the company's projects for the upcoming year. Graphics in the 10-K wrap will usually provide a brief overview of the company's financials, including revenue, net profit, costs, income, and any highlights from the previous year. The graphics may also outline the company's geographical reach or other elements of growth. Special Considerations As the 10-K wrap has evolved, it has come to include more images and content, such as a shareholder letter and high-quality photographs. However, pictures will often be kept to a minimum. The 10-K wrap document is usually no more than four pages long and could be even shorter, depending on what company executives want to see from the 10-K wrap report.

SEC Form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of financial performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their finances as a result of their business operations. The 10-Q is generally an unaudited report. A 10-Q must be filed for each of the first three quarters of the company's fiscal year. Key Takeaways SEC Form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of financial performance submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Form 10-Q contains financial statements, management discussion and analysis, disclosures, and internal controls for the previous quarter. Companies must file their 10-Qs 40 or 45 days after the end of their quarters, depending on the size of their public float. A snapshot of the company's financial position, Form 10-Q provides investors with information they can compare to previous periods and use to evaluate the outlook for the stock's performance. Form 10-Q is not an audited statement, unlike the annual Form 10-K companies are also required to file. Understanding SEC Form 10-Q Federal securities laws mandate that publicly traded companies provide certain information to shareholders and the general public. These disclosures may occur periodically or as specific events occur. A company utilizes Form 10-Q—one of many required by the SEC—upon the completion of each quarter to release unaudited financial statements and give an overview of the company’s financial situation. The exact filing dates depend on the organization’s fiscal year, but it is necessary to file three 10-Q reports each year. A 10-Q for the final quarter of the year is not required: After the fourth quarter, a company files Form 10-K, an annual report, instead. This report, unlike the 10-Q, is audited and tends to contain more details. A company's form 10-Q is public information. Anyone who wishes to examine a company's quarterly report can go to the SEC's EDGAR database. You can search by company name, ticker symbol, or SEC Central Index Key (CIK). Many companies also post their 10-Qs on their websites, in an ""Investor Relations"" section. SEC Form 10-Q Filing Deadlines The deadline for filing a 10-Q varies and depends on the number of outstanding shares a company has. A company filing a 10-Q is classified in one of three categories. Its category is determined by its public float—that is, the portion of outstanding stock that is in the hands of the public, and not held by officers, owners, or the government. Essentially, the float is comprised of all of a company’s freely traded common stock shares. The largest companies are classified as large accelerated filers. To meet this requirement, the organization must have at least $700 million in public float. If the company meets this requirement, it has 40 days after the close of the quarter to file its 10-Q. Accelerated filers are companies with at least $75 million in public float but less than $700 million. Accelerated filers also have 40 days to file the 10-Q (they have a little more time to file the 10-K). Finally, non-accelerated filers are companies with less than $75 million of public float. These companies have 45 days from the end of the quarter to file the 10-Q. 10-Q and 10-K Filing Deadlines Company Category 10-Q Deadline 10-K Deadline Large Accelerated Filer ($700MM or more) 40 days 60 days Accelerated Filer ($75–$700MM) 40 days 75 days Non-accelerated Filer (less than $75MM) 45 days 90 days Source: investor.gov Failure to Meet Form 10-Q Filing Deadline When a company fails to file a 10-Q by the filing deadline, it must use a non-timely (NT) filing. An NT filing must explain why the deadline has not been achieved, and it gives the company an additional five days to file. Companies are required to submit an NT 10-Q to request the extension and explain the delay. As long as a company has a reasonable explanation, the SEC allows late filings within a specified time period. Common reasons why companies are not able to file on time include mergers and acquisitions (M&A), corporate litigation, an ongoing review by corporate auditors, or lingering effects from a bankruptcy. A 10-Q filing is considered timely if it is filed within this extension. Failure to comply with this extended deadline results in consequences, including the potential loss of the SEC registration, removal from stock exchanges, and legal ramifications. Components of SEC Form 10-Q There are two parts to a 10-Q filing. The first part contains relevant financial information covering the period. This includes condensed financial statements, management discussion, and analysis on the financial condition of the entity, disclosures regarding market risk, and internal controls. The second part contains all other pertinent information. This includes legal proceedings, unregistered sales of equity securities, the use of proceeds from the sale of unregistered sales of equity, and defaults upon senior securities. The company discloses any other information—including the use of exhibits—in this section. Importance of SEC Form 10-Q The 10-Q provides a window into the financial health of the company. Investors can use the form to get a sense of its quarterly earnings and other elements of its operations, and to compare them to previous quarters—thus tracking its performance. Form 10-Q, and the requirement for filing it, was established by the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The aim was to promote transparency in public companies' operations, by providing investors with the financial position of companies on an ongoing basis. Some areas of interest to investors that are commonly visible in the 10-Q include changes to working capital and/or accounts receivables, factors affecting a company's inventory, share buybacks, and even any legal risks that a company faces. You can use a close competitor's 10-Q to compare that to a company in which you are invested, or considering to invest in, to see how it's performing. This will give you an idea of whether it's a strong choice, where its weaknesses are, and how it could stand to improve. Other Important SEC Filings The 10-Q is one of many reports public companies are required to file with the SEC. Other important and mandated filings include: Form 10-K: The 10-K must be filed once per year and includes the final quarter of the company's performance (replacing a fourth-quarter 10-Q). This report serves as a summary of the year, often containing more detailed information than an annual report, and must be filed within 90 days of the end of a company's fiscal year. The 10-K generally includes a summary of the company's operations, management's financial outlook, financial statements, and any legal or administrative issues involving the company. Form 8-K: This report is filed if there are any changes or developments to a business that didn't make the 10-Q or 10-K reports. This is considered an unscheduled document and may contain information such as press releases. If a company disposes of or acquires assets, has announcements of executive hiring or departures, or goes into receivership, this information is filed with an 8-K. Annual report: A company's annual report is filed every year, and contains a wealth of company news including—but not limited to—general information about the company, a letter to shareholders from the CEO, financial statements, and an auditors report. This report is submitted a few months after the end of a company's fiscal year. The report is available through a company's website or investor relations team, and can also be obtained from the SEC. Form 10-Q FAQs What Is a 10-Q Filing? A 10-Q filing is a report that all public companies must submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after the end of each of their first three fiscal quarters (hence the ""Q""). The filing is submitted by filling out a Form 10-Q. What Is the Difference Between a 10-K and a 10-Q? The main difference between Forms 10-K and 10-Q lies in the frequency and the amount of info they contain. Form 10-K is an annual report, filed at the end of a company's fiscal year. Filed just once, it summarizes all the data for the year, including the fourth quarter. In contrast, Form 10-Q is filed three times a year, at the end of a company's fiscal quarter. It details financial info for that quarter. Also, Form 10-K is an audited report. Form 10-Q generally is not. Are Public Companies Required to File Form 10-Q? Yes, all U. S. public companies issuing common shares of stock that trade on exchanges are required to file Form 10-Q. The date by which they have to file varies on the number of shares, expressed in terms of dollar worth, they have outstanding. Must Review Reports Accompany Financial Statements in a 10-Q? 10-Qs generally are not audited or accompanied by accountants' reports. SEC regulations prohibit companies from making materially false or misleading statements, or omitting material information to make disclosures not misleading. The SEC staff reviews 10-Qs and may provide comments to a company where disclosures appear to be inconsistent with the disclosure requirements or deficient in explanation or clarity.

Article Reviewed on March 11, 2020 Learn about our Financial Review Board Gordon Scott Updated Mar 13, 2020 What Is a 10-Year Treasury Note? The 10-year Treasury note is a debt obligation issued by the United States government with a maturity of 10 years upon initial issuance. A 10-year Treasury note pays interest at a fixed rate once every six months and pays the face value to the holder at maturity. The U.S. government partially funds itself by issuing 10-year Treasury notes. 1:34 10-Year Treasury Note Understanding 10-Year Treasury Notes The U.S. government issues three different types of debt securities to investors that are defined by the length of maturity, in order to fund its obligations: Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. Treasury bills (T-bills) have the shortest maturities, with durations only up to a year. The Treasury offers T-bills with maturities of four, eight, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. What makes T-bills unique in comparison to Treasury notes or Treasury bonds is that they are issued at discounts to par and pay no coupon payments. Investors are just paid the face value of the T-bills upon maturity, effectively making them zero-coupon bonds. Terms and Tracking Treasury notes (T-notes) are offered up to 10-year terms, making the 10-year T-note the one with the longest maturity. Other lengths of maturity for T-notes are two, three, five and seven years. The 10-year T-notes, and notes of shorter maturity, pay semiannual coupon payments and are not zero-coupon debt instruments. The 10-year T-note is the most widely tracked government debt instrument in finance, and its yield is often used as a benchmark for other interest rates, such as mortgage rates. Treasury bonds (T-bonds), like T-notes, pay semiannual coupon payments but are issued in terms of 30 years. Below is a chart of the 10-year Treasury yield from March 2019 to March 2020. During this one-year period, the yield steadily declined with expectations that the Federal Reserve would maintain low interest rates and potentially cut rates further. In late February 2020, the yield began to accelerate its decline as concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic began to rise sharply. When the Fed took emergency measures to cut rates by 50 basis points in early March, the decline of the 10-year yield accelerated even further, dipping below the psychologically important 1.00% level for a new record low. From there, the yield dropped all the way down to a low of 0.36% before rebounding. TradingView. The Advantages of Investing in Treasury Notes An advantage of investing in 10-year Treasury notes and other federal government securities is that the interest payments are exempt from state and local income taxes. However, they are still taxable at the federal level. The U.S. Treasury sells 10-year T-notes and notes of shorter maturities, as well as T-bills and bonds, directly through the TreasuryDirect website via competitive or noncompetitive bidding, with a minimum purchase of $100 and in $100 increments. They can also be purchased indirectly through a bank or broker. Investors can choose to hold Treasury notes until maturity or sell them early in the secondary market. There is no minimum ownership term. Although the Treasury issues new T-notes of shorter maturities every month, the new 10-year T-notes are issued only in February, May, August, and November (the origination months), with re-openings in the remaining months of the year. Re-openings are 10-year T-notes issued with the same maturity dates and interest rates as securities corresponding to the origination months. All T-notes are issued electronically, meaning investors do not hold actual paper reflecting the securities, similar to stocks.

A 100% equities strategy is a strategy commonly adopted by pooled funds, such as a mutual fund, that allocates all investable cash solely to stocks. Only equity securities are considered for investment, whether they be listed stocks, over-the-counter stocks, or private equity shares. Key Takeaways A 100% equities strategy is common among mutual funds that allocate all investable cash solely to stocks. In the 100% equity category, many funds will forsake high risk instruments such as derivatives, or riskier strategies such as short selling. With 100% equity strategies, fund categories can be further broken down into capital appreciation, aggressive growth, growth, value, capitalization, and income. Understanding 100% Equities Strategy 100% equities strategies represent funds that only choose investments from an equity universe. Generally, very few funds would be able to deploy all its capital in equity market investments without holding some cash and cash equivalents for transactions and operating activities. However, 100% equity strategies are still very prevalent in the market and encompass a large majority of offerings. Most 100% equity strategies will have an investment objective stating the fund will invest at least 80% in equities. The 80% threshold is a formality used in registration documentation for the majority of equity funds in the marketplace, with many funds deploying anywhere from 90% to 100% to equities. In the 100% equity category, many investors will seek funds that do not integrate higher risk instruments (such as derivatives) or riskier strategies (such as short selling), and instead take a more focused, traditional approach to equity investment. Equities are generally considered the riskier asset class over other leading alternatives, such as bonds and cash. A well diversified portfolio of all stocks can protect against individual company risk, or even sector risk, but market risks will still exist that can affect the equities asset class. Thus, both systemic and idiosyncratic risks are important considerations for aggressive equity investors. In the 100% equity strategy category, an investor will find a wide range of sub-classes to choose from, including those that focus on one, or a combination, of the following: capital appreciation, aggressive growth, growth, value, capitalization and income. Outlined below are some of the characteristics investors can expect from some of the most prominent 100% equity strategies. Growth Growth investing is a style used by many aggressive equity investors who are comfortable with higher risk investments and seek to take advantage of growing companies. The Russell 3000 Growth Index is a broad market index that helps to represent the growth category. Growth companies offer emerging technologies, new innovations, or a significant sector advantage that gives them above average expectations for revenue and earnings growth. Value Value stocks are often known as long term core holdings for an investor’s portfolio. These equity funds will rely on fundamental analysis to identify stocks that are undervalued in comparison to their fundamental value. Investment metrics for value investing often include price-to-earnings, price-to-book, and free cash flow. Income Income investing is also a top category for core long-term holdings in a portfolio. Income funds will invest in equities with a focus on current income. Income from equity investments is primarily focused on mature companies paying steady dividend rates. In the income category, real estate investment trusts and master limited partnerships are two publicly traded stock categories with unique incorporation structures that require them to pay high levels of income to equity investors. Capitalization Capitalization is a popular investing strategy for all equity portfolios. Generally, capitalization is broken down by large cap, mid cap, and small cap. Large-cap companies can offer the lowest risks, as they have established businesses and steady earnings that pay dividends. Small-cap companies are usually considered to have the highest risk since they are typically in the early stages of their development.

Article Reviewed on March 26, 2021 Learn about our Financial Review Board Lea D. Uradu Updated Mar 27, 2021 What Is Form 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return? Form 1040 is the standard Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form that individual taxpayers use to file their annual income tax returns. The form contains sections that require taxpayers to disclose their taxable income for the year to determine whether additional taxes are owed or whether the filer will receive a tax refund. Key Takeaways Form 1040 is what individual taxpayers use to file their taxes with the IRS. The form determines if additional taxes are due or if the filer will receive a tax refund. Personal information, such as name, address, Social Security number, and the number of dependents, are asked for on Form 1040. A filer also needs to report wages, salary, taxable interest, capital gains, pensions, Social Security benefits, and other types of income. Taxpayers may need to file supplemental tax 1040 forms depending on their situation. Understanding Form 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return Form 1040 needs to be filed with the IRS by April 15 in most years.﻿﻿ Everyone who earns income over a certain threshold must file an income tax return with the IRS (businesses have different forms to report their profits). The IRS has extended the 2020 federal tax filing date for individuals until May 17, 2021, due to the coronavirus pandemic—versus the previous deadline of April 15, 2021. As well, due to the winter storms that hit Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana in February 2021, the IRS has delayed the 2020 federal individual and business tax filing deadline for those states to June 15, 2021. The IRS overhauled the 1040 form for the 2018 tax year after passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), and it examined, according to the agency, ""ways to improve the 1040 filing experience."" The new, shorter 1040 was billed as easing communication of future tax-law changes and reducing the number of 1040s from which taxpayers must choose. The 1040 form for the tax year 2020, to be filed in 2021, includes two pages to fill out which are available on the IRS website. Form 1040 can be mailed in or e-filed. Form 1040 prompts tax filers for information on their filing status, such as name, address, Social Security number (some information on one's spouse may also be needed), and the number of dependents. The form also asks about full-year health coverage and whether the taxpayer wishes to contribute $3 to presidential campaign funds. All pages of Form 1040 are available on the IRS website.﻿﻿ The 1040 income section asks the filer to report wages, salary, taxable interest, capital gains, pensions, Social Security benefits, and other types of income. It also allows filers to claim the new higher standard deduction introduced with the Tax and Job Cuts Act. For 2020, these deductions are as follows: Single or married filing separately, $12,400 Married filing jointly or a qualifying widow(er), $24,800 Head of household, $18,650﻿﻿ For the tax year 2021, which will be filed in 2022, the numbers have increased and are as follows: Single or married filing separately, $12,550 Married filing jointly or a qualifying widow(er), $25,100 Head of household, $18,800﻿﻿ An additional deduction may be taken by those who are age 65 or older or blind (see ""Age/Blindness"" on the first page of Form 1040): Single or head of household filers, $1,650 Married filing jointly, $1,300 for each spouse who is 65 or older or blind. The new tax legislation eliminated many deductions, including for unreimbursed employee expenses, tax-preparation fees, and moving for a job (except for military on active duty).﻿﻿ The new 1040 uses what the IRS terms a ""building block"" approach and allows taxpayers to add only the schedules they need to their tax return. Some individuals may now need to file one or more of six new supplemental schedules with their 1040 in addition to long-standing schedules for such items as business income or loss, depending on whether they're claiming tax credits or owe additional taxes. Many individual taxpayers, however, only need to file a 1040 and no schedules. Taxpayers who receive dividends that total more than $1,500, for example, must file Schedule B, which is the section for reporting taxable interest and ordinary dividends.﻿﻿ Similarly, those who want to claim itemized deductions on their 1040 have to complete Schedule A. The IRS also has several worksheets to help taxpayers calculate the value of certain credits or deductions.﻿﻿ Types of Form 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return Taxpayers in certain situations may need to file a different variant of the 1040 form instead of the standard version. Below are the options. Form 1040-NR A variety of nonresident aliens or their representatives need to file this form: Those who are engaged in trade or business in the United States Representatives of a deceased person who would have had to file a Form 1040-NR Those who represent an estate or trust that had to file a 1040-NR Note that for tax years 2020 and later filers will no longer use Form 1040NR-EZ and instead will use the Form 1040-NR. As well, the IRS also produces the 1040-SS and 1040-PR. The 1040-SS is for residents of American Samoa, the CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands who has net self-employment income and does not have to file Form 1040 with the U.S. Form 1040-PR is the Spanish-language equivalent of Form 1040-SS. Form 1040-ES This form is used to figure and pay estimated quarterly taxes. The estimated tax applies to income that isn’t subject to withholding, which includes earnings from self-employment, interest, dividends, and rents. This may also include unemployment compensation, pension income, and the taxable portion of Social Security benefits. Form 1040-V This is a statement accompanying a taxpayer's payment for any balance on the ""Amount you owe"" line of the 1040 or 1040-NR. Form 1040X If a filer makes a mistake or forgets to include information on any 1040 form, Form 1040X is used for making changes to previously filed 1040s. Form 1040-SR The IRS introduced a new 1040 form for seniors in 2019. Changes include a larger font, no shading (shaded sections can be hard to read), and a standard deduction chart that includes the extra standard deduction for seniors. Seniors who fill out their taxes online won't notice the difference, but those who do it on paper should benefit.

Article Reviewed on March 31, 2021 Learn about our Financial Review Board Lea D. Uradu Updated Mar 31, 2021 What Was Form 1040-A: U.S. Individual Tax Return? Form 1040-A of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was a simplified version of Form 1040 used by U.S. taxpayers to file an annual income tax return. To have been eligible to use Form 1040-A, an individual needed to meet certain requirements such as not itemizing deductions, not owning a business, and having a taxable income of less than $100,000. Unofficially known as the ""short form,"" Form 1040-A was eliminated for the 2018 tax year in favor of the redesigned Form 1040 that debuted that year. Key Takeaways Form 1040-A was a simplified version of Form 1040 used for filing individual income tax. Filers using 1040-A were required to have less than $100,000 in taxable income and not have exercised any incentive stock options during the year. The IRS eliminated Form 1040-A for the 2018 tax year in favor of the redesigned Form 1040. Another variant of Form 1040 was Form 1040-EZ, which was even simpler than Form 1040-A and was also eliminated starting with the 2018 tax filing. Who Had to File Form 1040-A: U.S. Individual Tax Return? Most U.S. taxpayers use IRS Form 1040 to file their income tax returns. Form 1040 is a detailed form that offers taxpayers with complex investments, itemized deductions, multiple tax credits, and more than $100,000 in annual income more opportunities to lower their tax liability. Because additional paperwork is usually required with Form 1040, individuals with simpler tax situations previously had the option to use Form 1040-A instead.﻿﻿ Form 1040-A was a simplified version of Form 1040. The two-page form allowed taxpayers to report ordinary income, some deductions, and credits. Individuals who fell under any of the five status options—single, head of household, married filing separately, married filing jointly, or widowed—could file their tax returns using the 1040-A. Though Form 1040-A was available to taxpayers of any age and filing status, not everyone qualified to use this form.﻿﻿ Tax filers who used 1040-A must have earned less than $100,000 taxable income and not have exercised any incentive stock options (ISO) during the tax year. The income reported must have been earned as a wage, salary, tip, capital gain, dividend, interest income, unemployment compensation, pension, annuity, taxable Social Security and railroad retirement benefit, taxable scholarship or grant, and Alaska Permanent Fund dividend. Any other form of income, such as business income, needed to be reported on the more complex Form 1040.﻿﻿ How Did Form 1040-A Work? Form 1040-A also gave taxpayers the opportunity to claim several tax deductions to reduce their taxable income. However, the only deductions they could claim included student loan interest, post-secondary tuition and fees, classroom expenses, and individual retirement account (IRA) contributions. Taxpayers using Form 1040-A could not claim itemized deductions. This limitation meant that if an individual qualified for other deductions from sources such as charitable donations or mortgage interest, and the total itemized deductible amount was more than the standard deductions, it would not have been advantageous for them to use 1040-A. Form 1040-A also could be used to claim tax credits. Tax credits reduce the bottom line or total tax bill of a taxpayer. The credits that could be claimed using this form were the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), Earned Income Credit (EITC), child tax and additional child tax credit, child and dependent care credit, credits for the elderly or disabled, and retirement savings contribution credit. Form 1040-A vs. Form 1040-EZ Another variant of Form 1040 was Form 1040-EZ, which was even simpler and easier to fill out than Form 1040-A and was also eliminated starting with the 2018 tax filing. But with Form 1040-EZ, the individual had to file as either a single taxpayer or as married filing jointly; they could not claim deductions and could only claim the EIC.﻿﻿ Although Form 1040-A was slightly more complex than Form 1040-EZ, it was still relatively simple compared to 1040. Once their financial situation became complicated with dependents, special deductions, and credits—such as those associated with post-secondary education tuition—most taxpayers needed to switch from filing with the 1040-EZ to the 1040-A. The redesigned Form 1040 that debuted with the 2018 tax year is designed to be much simpler to use than its predecessor. For this reason, the IRS eliminated both Form 1040-A and Form 1040-EZ.﻿﻿ Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

IRS Form 1040EZ: Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers with No Dependents was the shortened version of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040. This form was for taxpayers with basic tax situations and offered a fast and easy way to file income taxes. The form was discontinued as of the 2018 tax year in favor of the redesigned Form 1040. Key Takeaways Form 1040EZ was a shortened version of Form 1040 for taxpayers with basic tax situations. The form was discontinued as of the 2018 tax year and replaced with the redesigned Form 1040. Anyone who hasn't filed a tax return using Form 1040EZ for tax years 2017 and earlier can still do so by going to the IRS website. Who Can File Form 1040EZ: Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers with No Dependents? To use the form, a taxpayer had to have taxable income of less than $100,000, less than $1,500 of interest income, and claim no dependents. Other requirements for filing the Form 1040EZ included: The taxpayer and their spouse, if married filing jointly, had to be under age 65 at the end of the relevant filing period They could not be blind as of the end of the relevant filing period The filer could take no deductions for student loan interest, educator expenses, tuition and fees, and or itemized deductions If the filer received interest income, they could not have been required to file Schedule B, didn’t have amounts in boxes 11, 12, or 13 of Form 1099-INT or boxes 6 and 10 of Form 1099-OID, and didn’t earn any interest as a nominee Tax credits for retirement savings, health coverage, and education were not allowed The tax filer could not have received any advance earned income credit (EIC), although they would have been allowed to claim the EIC when filing Form 1040EZ The filer could not be a debtor in any Chapter 11 bankruptcy case that was filed after October 16, 2005 The filer, their spouse, if married filing jointly, or any of their dependents for which they claimed the personal exemption didn’t receive any advance payments of the premium tax credit offered for health coverage plans sold on the Marketplace The filer doesn’t owe any household employee taxes on wages paid to household employees﻿﻿ For most individuals, the 1040EZ was the first tax form they ever completed. Consider a typical high-school student employed part-time. Provided they met the income qualifications, the 1040EZ will likely be the most straightforward and appropriate form to file. Form 1040EZ vs. Form 1040 Form 1040EZ had only a few credits or deductions available to taxpayers. Filers were able to include an earned income credit (EIC) and elect nontaxable combat pay. For most tax years, Form 1040 had 80% more lines than form 1040EZ. One significant difference was that Form 1040 had fields to include information about dependents, while 1040EZ did not allow individuals to claim dependents. Similar to the standard form, the EZ version had sections to record wages, salaries and tips, and taxable interest under $1,500. The filer was also able to include unemployment compensation payments. Form 1040EZ allowed filers to claim income from wages, tips, salaries, taxable grants or scholarships, the Alaska Permanent Fund, and unemployment compensation. Form 1040, though, had at least 16 income categories. Categories available on the standard form included dividend payments, retirement account distributions, and farm and rental income. Form 1040 also allowed the entry of Social Security benefits, alimony, and other forms of income. This form also had a long list of deductions, ranging from education costs to healthcare savings plan contributions.

SEC Release IA-1092 builds on the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or the Advisers Act that Congress enacted to protect persons who rely on investment advisers for advice on purchasing and selling securities. Key Takeaways SEC Release IA-1092 clarifies how state and federal securities laws apply to investment advisers and financial planners. This memo, which was issued in 1987, expands on the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. IA-1092 defines the roles and duties of investment advisers and pension consultants, in particular. Understanding SEC Release IA-1092 SEC Release IA-1092 is the result of a 1987 collaboration between the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on the federal side and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) on the state side. These organizations issued IA-1092 in 1987 as a memo in response to the proliferation of financial planning and investment advice professionals in the 1980s. The act reaffirmed the definition of an investment adviser (IA) as described in SEC Release IA-770 and added some refinements: First, pension consultants and advisers to athletes and entertainers were included as providers of investment advice. Second, in some cases, firms that recommend investment advisers also had to register themselves. Even if an IA did not render investment advice as his or her principal business activity, simply doing so with some regularity in many cases was enough to require registration. If a registered representative of a broker-dealer set up a separate business entity to provide financial planning or investment advice for a fee, she or he was not allowed to rely on the broker-dealer (BD) exemption from registration. (This became known as a statutory investment adviser.) Compensation did not have to be monetary to fall under the definition. Simply the receipt of products, services, or even discounts was also considered compensation. With regard to sports or entertainment agents, those individuals that negotiated contracts but did not render investment advice were excluded from the definition of an investment adviser. SEC Release IA-1092 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 defines an investment adviser as any person who, either directly or indirectly through writings, engages in the business of advising others on the value or profitability of securities and receives compensation for this. Guidelines for the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 can be found in Title 15 section 80b-1 of the United States Code, which notes that investment advisers are of national concern, due to: Their advice, counsel, publications, writings, analyses, and reports being in line with interstate commerce. Their work customarily relating to the purchase and sale of securities that trade on national securities exchanges and in interstate over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Their connection with securities issued by companies engaged in interstate commerce. The volume of transactions often materially affecting interstate commerce, national securities exchanges, other securities markets, the national banking system, and even the economy as a whole.

The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) is a monthly weighted average of the interest rates paid on checking and savings accounts offered by financial institutions operating in Arizona, California, and Nevada. It is one of many indices used by mortgage lenders to adjust the interest rate on adjustable rate mortgages (ARM) and was launched in 1981. With an ARM mortgage, the interest rate on a mortgage moves up and down along with some standard interest rate chosen by the lender, and COFI is one of the most popular indices in the western states. Published on the last day of each month, the COFI represents the cost of funds for western savings institutions that are members of Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, a self-regulatory agency, and satisfy the Bank's criteria for inclusion in the index. Understanding the 11th District COFI The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) is computed using several different factors, with interest paid on savings accounts comprising the largest weighting in the average. As a result, the index tends to have low volatility and follow market interest rate changes somewhat slowly; it is generally regarded as a two-month lagging indicator of market interest rates. The interest rate on a mortgage will not match the COFI, rather the ARM rate is typically 2% to 3% higher than COFI, depending on the borrower's credit history, the size and terms of the loan, the ability of the borrower to negotiate with the bank and many other factors. Because it is computed using data from three western states, the COFI is primarily used in the western U.S., while the 1-year Treasury index is the measure of choice in the eastern region. On April 30, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco announced the COFI for March 2018 of 0.814%, slightly lower than February.

She is an expert in personal financial planning and practices as a financial therapist. Article Reviewed on March 01, 2021 Learn about our Financial Review Board Erika Rasure Updated Mar 1, 2021 What Is a 125% Loan? A 125% loan is a loan—usually a mortgage—with an initial loan amount equal to 125% (1.25x) of the initial property value. For example, if your home is worth $300,000, a 125% loan would let you borrow $375,000. These loans first became common during the 1990s, geared toward borrowers with high credit scores and exemplary credit histories who wanted additional capital beyond their available home equity. Because they are riskier to lenders, these tend to carry higher interest rates than traditional loans, as much as double the rate of standard mortgages. How a 125% Loan Works In technical financing terminology, a 125% loan has a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 125%. A primary measure of a loan's default risk to a lender is the size of a loan relative to the value of the underlying property. A 125% loan is a relatively risky loan as compared to a loan with an LTV ratio of less than 100%. In fact, with conventional mortgages, the loan size does not typically exceed 80% of a property's value. Therefore, according to the risk-based pricing method used by lenders, a loan with an LTV ratio of 125% will carry a higher interest rate than a loan with a LTV ratio of 100% or below. Homeowners could seek a 125% loan as a refinancing option in order to give them greater access to capital than what is available in their home equity. Their motive might be to use the loan as a way to pay off other debts that carry higher interest rates, such as credit cards. The comparatively lower interest rate of the mortgage, even on a 125% loan, could mean making smaller payments and a lower principal balance, which would increase the principal more rapidly. Because they involve a sum that's greater than the value of the property being mortgaged, a 125% loan carries higher interest rates than conventional loans. History of 125% Loans 125% loans played a role in the 2007-08 housing crisis. The crash of real estate markets around the country, kicked off by the subprime mortgage meltdown, left many people “underwater”—that is, they owed more money on their mortgage than the home was actually worth. It was not unheard of to find homeowners indebted to pay off mortgages with rates and principal balances that no longer reflected the value of the residences they were paying for. As home values dropped, homeowners may have wanted to refinance, but to qualify they might have been required to have paid a certain percentage of equity in the home. The drastic changes in the market made it difficult to secure refinancing; moreover, continued payments into their existing mortgages would likely mean they could not recoup their losses even if they attempted to sell the home. The federal Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) was created in March 2009 as a way to offer relief. It allowed homeowners whose home were underwater, but who were otherwise in good standing and current with their mortgages, to apply for refinancing. Through HARP, homeowners who owed up to 125% of the value of their homes could seek to refinance at lower rates to help them pay off their debts and get on a sounder financial footing. Originally, homeowners who owed more than that percentage could not apply, but eventually, even the 125% LTV ceiling was removed, allowing even more homeowners to apply for HARP loans. After being extended several times, the HARP program ended in December 2018. Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Article Reviewed on March 23, 2020 Learn about our Financial Review Board Gordon Scott Updated Mar 23, 2020 What Is a 12B-1 Fee? A 12b-1 fee is an annual marketing or distribution fee on a mutual fund. The 12b-1 fee is considered to be an operational expense and, as such, is included in a fund's expense ratio. It is generally between 0.25% and 0.75% (the maximum allowed) of a fund's net assets. The fee gets its name from a section of the Investment Company Act of 1940. 1:33 12b-1 Fee Understanding 12B-1 Fees Back in the early days of the mutual fund business, the 12b-1 fee was thought to help investors. It was believed that by marketing a mutual fund, its assets would increase and management could lower expenses because of economies of scale. This has yet to be proven. With mutual fund assets passing the $10 trillion mark and growing steadily, critics of this fee are seriously questioning the justification for using it. Today, the 12b-1 fee is mainly used to reward intermediaries for selling a fund's shares. As a commission paid to salespersons, it is currently believed to do nothing to enhance the performance of a fund. In 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began examining the use of 12b-1 fees to determine if the rules for charging these fees are being adhered to and the presence of such fees is being properly disclosed. 12b-1 Fee Broken Down The 12b-1 fee can be broken down into two distinct charges: the distribution and marketing fee and the service fee. Total 12b-1 fees charged by a fund are limited to 1% annually. The distribution and marketing piece of the fee is capped at 0.75% annually, while the service fee portion of the fee can be up to 0.25%. Use of 12b-1 in Broker-Sold Shares Class B and class C shares of broker-sold funds typically have 12b-1 fees, but they may also be charged on no-load mutual fund shares and class A broker-sold shares. Class A shares, which usually charge a front-end load but no back-end load, may come with a reduced 12b-1 expense but normally don't come with the maximum 1% fee. Class B shares, which typically carry no front-end but charge a back-end load that decreases as time passes, often come with a 12b-1 fee. Class C shares usually have the greatest likelihood of carrying the maximum 1% 12b-1 fee. The presence of a 12b-1 fee frequently pushes the overall expense ratio on a fund to above 2%. The Calamos Growth Fund is an example of a fund that carries a smaller 0.25% 12b-1 fee on its class A shares and charges the maximum 1% 12b-1 fee on its class C shares. What 12b-1 Fees Are Used For The distribution fee covers marketing and paying brokers who sell shares. They also go toward advertising the fund and mailing fund literature and prospectuses to clients. Shareholder service fees, another form, specifically pay for the fund to hire people to answer investor inquiries and distribute information when necessary, though these fees may be required without the adoption of a 12b-1 plan. Another category of fees that can be charged is known as ""other expenses."" Other expenses can include costs associated with legal, accounting, and administrative services. They may also pay for transfer agent and custodial fees.

A 12b-1 fund is a type of mutual fund that charges its holders a 12b-1 fee. A 12b-1 fee is a fee used to pay for a mutual fund’s distribution costs. It is often used as a commission to brokers for selling the fund; 12b-1 funds take a portion of investment assets held and use them to pay expensive fees and distribution costs. These costs are included in the fund's expense ratio and are described in the prospectus. Notably, 12b-1 fees are sometimes called a “level load.” Key Takeaways A 12b-1 fund is a type of mutual fund that charges investors a 12b-1 fee, which covers a fund's so-called distribution costs. The fee is a percentage of the fund's market value, as opposed to funds that charge a load or sales fee. 12b-1 fees include the cost of marketing and selling fund shares, paying brokers and other sellers of the funds, as well as advertising costs, such as printing and mailing fund prospectuses to investors. While once popular, 12b-1 funds have lost investor interest in recent years, particularly amid the rise of exchange-traded funds and many low-cost mutual funds. Understanding a 12b-1 Fund The name 12b-1 comes from the Investment Company Act of 1940's Rule 12b-1, which allows fund companies to act as distributors of their own shares. Rule 12b-1 further states that a mutual fund's own assets can be used to pay distribution charges. How a 12b-1 Fund Works Distribution fees include fees paid for marketing and selling fund shares, such as compensating brokers and others who sell fund shares and paying for advertising, the printing and mailing of prospectuses to new investors, and the printing and mailing of sales literature. The SEC does not limit the size of 12b-1 fees that funds may pay, but under FINRA rules, 12b-1 fees that are used to pay marketing and distribution expenses (as opposed to shareholder service expenses) cannot exceed 0.75% of a fund’s average net assets per year. Some 12b-1 plans also authorize and include ""shareholder service fees,"" which are fees paid to persons to respond to investor inquiries and provide investors with information about their investments. A fund may pay shareholder service fees without adopting a 12b-1 plan. If shareholder service fees are part of a fund’s 12b-1 plan, these fees will be included in this category of the fee table. If shareholder service fees are paid outside a 12b-1 plan, then they will be included in the ""Other expenses"" category, discussed below. FINRA imposes an annual 0.25% cap on shareholder service fees (regardless of whether these fees are authorized as part of a 12b-1 plan). Originally, the rule was intended to pay advertising and marketing expenses; today, however, a very small percentage of the fee tends to go toward these costs. 0.75% The maximum amount of a fund's net assets that an investor can be charged as a 12b-1 fee. Special Considerations 12b-1 funds have fallen out of favor in recent years. The growth in exchange traded fund (ETF) options and the subsequent growth of low-fee mutual fund options has given consumers a wide range of option. Notably, 12b-1 fees are considered a dead weight, and experts believe consumers who shop around can find comparable funds to ones charging 12b-1 fees.

It came from a well-known historical figure. Not only did the gentleman discover the principles of vaccination, he created the first vaccines for rabies, cholera, and anthrax. He also discovered the process of pasteurization, which was named after him. His discovery of the vaccination process has saved countless lives over the past century and is especially important in this age of the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. A world-renowned biologist, microbiologist, and chemist, Louis Pasteur’s work continues to influence medicine and science more than a century after death. He founded the non-profit Institut Pasteur in Paris more than 130 years ago. The institute is a wonderful legacy to a great man and continues to play an important role in the battle against infectious diseases. The quote from Pasteur that captured my interest is: “These three things-work, will, success-fill human existences. Will opens the door to success, both brilliant and happy. Work passes these doors, and at the end of the journey success comes in to crown one’s efforts.” Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) The simple pathway to success Pasteur laid out remains valid today. Let’s look at the three-part process he mentions. Will What would life be without the will of both man and woman? The Oxford Dictionary defines will as “the faculty by which a person decides on and initiates action.” The type of will that drives a person to do something, to become something, to help others. This is also the will to live, thrive, and toward accomplishment. Without this “faculty” or internal drive, mankind would have a difficult time on this planet. This will provides the determination and drive to keep moving forward in life. This “will opens the door to success” and fortunately is available to anyone who wishes to use it. Work All of mankind must work. While we may work in different ways, work it is. It can be work in the home, on a job, to get an education, in anything, anywhere, and everywhere. We work to grow when we are young, mature as we age, maintain, sustain, and advance our lives. Yes, everyone works in some way. You can even work on relaxing or getting a suntan! According to scripture, work started in a garden: “The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.” Genesis 2:15 NIV Ever since that day, men and women have been working. To live is to work, and to work is to live. It makes sense that the more you enjoy the work you do, the more you love life, and the more you love life, the more you enjoy the work you do. Work is required to open the door of success, and if you notice, Pasteur mentions “doors,” and there certainly is more than one door through which we will enter as we head toward each success in life. Success I am glad Pasteur did not define success. Success is such an all-encompassing word. There is no one thing that makes a person successful. Success is as individual as we are, and its definition is to each of us what we make it. Success does crown our efforts. I like the imagery this gives us. The little and big successes each receive their own crown or reward as we move through life. Final words These three things, will, work, and success, truly fill our existence. It all starts with the will to live, and as we mature, it becomes a determination to succeed. This work naturally provides us with some kind of success and reward. In my mind, the greatest crown we can ever receive is when we help others succeed in their lives. In the end, success in our lives is defined by the relationships we had while living. Relationships are the ultimate crown of life as they are life, and they are what give us life and make it all worthwhile. Life does not exist without them. I leave you with this question: “How can the work I do open the door to success (as I define it) in my life?” And I challenge you to consider: “What can I begin doing today to make it happen?” LinkedIn |Twitter| Medium| UncommonSense| AmazonAuthorPage Bill Abbate Leadership Writer and Editor in ILLUMINATION Thank you for reading this article!

You Got This Be your own best cheerleader by taking action Chad Prevost Just now·3 min read Photo by Priscilla Du Preez on Unsplash Dear Big Selfer, Our writers have been sending a clear message: We don’t really need self-help to help ourselves. Then again, our writers do their research to bring you what you just might be needing right now. Maybe it’s a counter-intuitive idea, an approach to a mindset you hadn’t considered. Maybe it’s a friendly slap on the back for some encouragement. Maybe it’s the wisdom that comes from some personal, lived experience. Whatever the case, there’s a balance between being and doing, and we at Big Self feel certain of one thing: You got this. In You Don’t Need Motivation — You Need a Better Environment Nabil Alouani says you need to hitch up your britches and take some personal responsibility for getting going. It’s a cycle. As he writes, “In reality, motivation and action are tied together in a loop that goes like this: Motivation generates action, and action generates motivation.” I’m down. How about you? Check out his full article here: You Don’t Need Motivation — You Need a Better Environment You could say no one else sums up the idea of personal responsibility more than Maria Milojković, who’s seen a thing or two since surviving 78 days of bombing back in the day. In No One Can Tell You How to Live Your Life with 5 Simple Hacks, Maria expounds on her ideas of how life is uncertain, everything is (probably) going to be okay, and most importantly, if you can realize and accept the complexity, you got this. Check out her full article here: No One Can Tell You How to Live Your Life with 5 Simple Hacks. Similarly, Evan Wildstein’s How Time and Experience Are Sage Teachers begins with the premise: “We know that we don’t know.” He likes this approach to unknown because: “That phrase leans into uncertainty, with a hopeful tinge. There’s a veritable canyon-full of information out there that none of us know. And one of the great joys of self-discovery and lifelong learning is approaching much of life that way — acknowledging there are gaps, and working to fill them.” Check out his full article here to learn more about the best teachers in life: How Time and Experience Are Sage Teachers. Last but not least, Marta Brzosko has been practicing some personal cancel culture all her own leading up to the milestone of her 30th birthday in her piece, Don’t Put Off Your Rest For When You “Deserve.” She’s setting some clear boundaries, and with this comes “both a sense of relief and guilt for prioritizing rest so radically.” In her typical authentic style, Marta unpacks her feelings and self-assesses what it means to work hard and to prioritize rest. Check out her full article here: Don’t Put Off Your Rest For When You “Deserve.” Take a pit stop on your way to having a strong mid-April week. You just might need this.

The ego gets fixated on specific ideas and outcomes and this is not to say you can’t manifest specific things — you can — but when you feel a strong desire to manifest a specific job or a specific person, usually this is coming from the ego.

The only way we get to improve our self-esteem and develop a healthy sense of self — carry ourselves confidently and create a great self-image, is through discipline. A lot of people struggling with low self-esteem are more likely to also struggle with self-discipline. The more disciplined we are, the more orderly our lives become. Also, the more our results and our productivity goes up. Which helps us to slowly develop our sense of self-worth. To understand what discipline does to you, you must understand what indiscipline does to your psyche. It erodes your sense of pride which in turn affects your confidence. Discipline is the simple vehicle that carries us from where we are to where we want to be. It takes a disciplined writer to make it on this platform. It takes a disciplined person to change their life and put away bad habits eating at their opportunities. I have highlighted key points that have served me so well. And with determination, the wind of discipline can take you further in life. Start with the day before A successful day is a disciplined day. The secret to a disciplined day is that it starts the day before. It doesn’t just happen. We do not leave the day to chance, we take control of it. We sit in the driver seat and determine in what direction it goes. Learn to take control of your life. The moment you begin to feel like things are outside your control, that's the moment everything starts crumbling down. You want to unlearn such a mindset. Why so many people seem to just want to get through the day, disciplined people try to get from the day. The key, therefore, is to plan for it ahead. Get out your day timer, and chronicle your activities for the next day. Plan it out as best as you can, starting with the most difficult tasks. As Brian Tracy said in his book, Eat That Frog, you want to start with the bigger task first. That way it becomes easier to crush the less big task of the day. Have a clear outcome in mind It pays to have a clear outcome — to have a “what the result will be like” picture in mind. If you engage in such and such an action, what do you hope to get from it? Be clear — have a vivid mental image of what you are expecting. Jim Rohn remarked; “the clearer the promise, the easier it is to pay the price.” Ask yourself, what is the promise? How do you hope to feel after? What value would it add to your life? What would keeping such a commitment do to your self-esteem, self-confidence and self-worth? Create a very clear image of the end result/reward — it will serve as a powerful incentive to get the job done. Do one thing at a time Due to how our social world is evolving now, with our little devices, we’ve been programmed to feel we need to multitask and get many things done in such an amount of time. Do not buy into that mindset. Doing more doesn't mean getting more done. If you’ve been going all day, take a break and ask yourself, what have you really accomplished all day? Do not mistake movement for achievement. Discipline becomes easy when we focus on one task and put all our energy and attention into it. It helps the mind to stay focus. Our mind is not capable of holding more than one task at a time. The fact that you can chat with a friend while binge-watching Netflix doesn't mean the same bad attitude will be effective in the workplace or with the things that truly need your discipline and undivided attention. Develop a routine A routine is the best mechanism that helps go-getter achieve their goals. Having a routine means you’re ready to be productive. It means you've structured your day to maximise productivity. Productivity which is only achieved through discipline doesn't just fall on our laps — we must go seeking. We make the mistake to believe that discipline just happens — we either have it or we do not. That isn’t true! You can plan to be disciplined. As I have learned in my struggle, as someone who once battled with being indisciplined, it indeed becomes a truism that we sure can work towards been disciplined. It starts by drawing out a routine — a plan to have a disciplined day. To have a disciplined day simply create a routine that enables you to move from one task to another seamlessly. If there is anything that serves me so well in the area of being disciplined, is creating a routine and sticking to it. Avoid unnecessary credits When you push things to a future time, you are creating a credit. When there’s something that needs to be done, do it. At that moment, you could feel like doing it later — it is no big deal. But do not budge. Before you get into the mindset of negotiating whether to do it or not, stand up on your feet and get it done. There is no I’ll do it later. Doing it later is robbing that future time of its own use. It’s like my girlfriend always say whenever I speak of borrowing money; “borrowing is like taking from tomorrow, and when tomorrow finally comes, it becomes empty.” Money is also just like time — they’re both resources meant to be spent. We can either spend it wisely and get a positive result in form of productivity, or get negative results that will show up as unproductivity. Integrate pause/break into your routine There is what is called the Pomodoro technique developed in 1980 by Francesco Cirillo, which helps create a system for better time management. The technique involves creating a timer that enables you to break works into intervals or parts. You can set the time of work to be 25 minutes, and then you take a short break of 5 minutes. This is so useful as it helps the brain to develop the least resistance. Practising discipline takes enormous mental energy and as someone who is just starting, you want to take it easy, else it will all come crashing down. The goal of using this technique is to trick the brain that by just working for 25 minutes, you can go for a walk or do something fun for 5 minutes. I use this technique for writing and it has helped me write more without feeling bored, tired or even making writing feel tedious which can often occur when we go all cold turkey trying to write a few articles in one seating. Place a reward at the end When I got on the treadmill of developing self-discipline, I realised that the brain is like a child — in that, it can be negotiated with, and it will really listen. I got this trick from the Canadian psychologist, Jordan Peterson; “that we should negotiate with ourselves and not torture ourselves with the whip of discipline.” And indeed discipline sometimes can feel like torture which wears out the brain and sucks the joy out of doing things that were supposed to be fun. What I have found to work for me, is to negotiate with my brain like I would a child by setting a system of reward for any task I have set to accomplished. You have to find a good reward that works for you. It could be a walk in the park, playing video games or watching some episodes of your favourite movies on Netflix. In the end, we must realise that discipline is everything. And self-motivation is actually the only motivation there really is to success or happiness in your life. We cannot wait on others or something to come motivate us and keep us disciplined. I have learned this the hard way and even on this platform. There is an old African proverb that says “if there is no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm.” The enemy we have to worry about, standing between us and our dreams, is us. If we fail to cultivate the habit of discipline, to do that which is necessary, we can not win at anything in life. Going over the point again to cultivate self-discipline; Start with the day before Have a clear outcome in mind Do one thing at a time Work with a routine Avoid unnecessary credits Integrate pause/break into your routine Place a reward at the end I Tried to Run Again, After 2 Years, and this is What I Learned Mastery isn’t permanent medium.com 12 Tricks To Kick Your Worst Life Habits 1.

The 1979 energy crisis, the second of two oil price shocks in the '70s, resulted in a widespread panic about potential gasoline shortages, and far higher prices for both crude oil and refined products. Oil output declined by only 7% or less, but the short-term supply disruption led to a spike in prices, panic buying, and long lines at gas stations. Key Takeaways The energy crisis of 1979 was one of two oil price shocks during the 1970s—the other was in 1973. Higher prices and concerns about supplies led to panic buying in the gasoline market. Crude oil prices nearly doubled to almost $40 per barrel in twelve months. The energy crisis of 1979 led to the development of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. OPEC's market share fell sharply and utility companies moved toward alternative energy sources. Understanding the 1979 Energy Crisis The 1979 energy crisis occurred in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution, which started in early 1978 and ended in early 1979 with the fall of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the state’s monarch. Turmoil in Iran, a major petroleum exporting country, caused the global supply of crude oil to decline significantly, triggering noteworthy shortages, and a surge in panic buying—within 12 months, the price per barrel of this widely used resource almost doubled to $39.50. Short-run disruptions in the global supply of gasoline and diesel fuel were particularly acute in the spring and early summer of 1979. Several states responded by rationing gasoline, including California, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and New Jersey. In these populous states, consumers could only purchase gas every other day, based on whether the last digit of their license plate numbers was even or odd. The gasoline shortage also led to fears that heating oil might be in short supply through the 1979-1980 winter. This prospect was especially concerning for New England states, where demand for home heating oil was the highest. Special Considerations It would be erroneous to blame the crisis solely on the fall of the Shah. Notably, the U.S. faced more-acute pain from the crisis than other developed countries in Europe, which also depended on oil from Iran and other Middle East countries. Part of the reason behind the crisis had to do with fiscal policy decisions in the U.S. U.S. Fiscal Policy Also to Blame In early 1979, the U.S. government regulated oil prices. Regulators ordered refiners to restrict the supply of gasoline in the early days of the crisis to build inventories, directly contributing to higher prices at the pump. Another factor was unintended supply restriction after the Department of Energy (DOE) decided to make a handful of large U.S. refiners sell crude to smaller refiners who could not find a ready supply of oil. Because smaller refiners had limited production capabilities, the decision further delayed gasoline supply. Monetary policy leading up to the crisis also seemingly played a role to a degree. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was reluctant to raise target interest rates too quickly and this hesitation contributed to rising inflation late in the decade. The jump in inflation was accompanied by higher prices for energy and a range of other consumer products and services. Benefits of the 1979 Energy Crisis Amid the crisis, politicians actively encouraged consumers to conserve energy and limit unnecessary travel. In subsequent years, the 1979 crisis led to the sale of more compact and subcompact vehicles in the U.S. These smaller vehicles had smaller engines and provided better fuel economy. In addition, the crisis prompted utility companies worldwide to seek out alternatives to crude oil generators, including nuclear power plants, and governments to spend billions on the research and development (R&D) of other fuel sources. Combined, these efforts resulted in daily worldwide oil consumption declining in the six years following the crisis. Meanwhile, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) global market share fell to 29% in 1985, down from 50% in 1979.

The term 2-1 buydown refers to a type of mortgage product with a set of two initial temporary-start interest rates that increase in stair-step fashion until it reaches a permanent interest rate. The initial interest rate reductions are either paid for by the borrower to help them qualify for a mortgage or by a builder as an incentive to purchase a home. Key Takeaways A 2-1 buydown is a type of financing that lowers the interest rate on a mortgage for the first two years before reaching a permanent rate. Sellers and builders may offer buydown options to make a property more attractive to buyers, making payments during the initial period to the lender to subsidize the difference. In a 2-1 buydown, the rate is lowered by two points during the first year, by one in the second year, then goes back to the settled rate after the buydown period expires. How 2-1 Buydowns Work A buydown is a type of financing that makes it much easier for a borrower to qualify for a mortgage with a lower interest rate. This involves the seller or homebuilder making additional payments to the lender in exchange for a reduction in the interest rate for the first few years of the mortgage for temporary buydowns or for the entire length of the loan for permanent buydowns. Sellers and builders may offer these options to make a property more attractive to buyers. This effectively means the buyer gets a discount on their mortgage. 2-1 buydowns are considered temporary buydowns. With this mortgage option, the interest rate is reduced for the first two years of the mortgage. So a mortgagor who negotiates an interest rate of 5% for their $250,000 property can effectively lower their rate for the first two years using a 2-1 buydown—to 3% for the first year and 4% for the second year. After the two year period is over, the interest rate then goes back up to 5% for the remainder of the mortgage. Payments made by the seller or builder help subsidize the difference which is paid to the lender. A 2-1 buydown is that it affords the borrower the chance to build up their finances to better accommodate the payments on a mortgage. It also allows them to qualify to purchase a home at a higher price than they could normally afford. Part of the assumption is that the borrower’s salary will increase during this timeframe, thus giving them greater leeway to pay for the remaining life of the mortgage. Choosing such a buydown based on expectations of income increases may present a risk of the borrower’s household salary does not rise at the anticipated rate. If the borrower does not see income increase on a par with the payments that will be due after the buydown expires, they may face losses. Special Considerations The cost of a buydown is an upfront payment to reduce monthly mortgage payments. It is sometimes calculated and placed in an escrow account where a certain amount is paid out equal to the difference in the temporary mortgage payment each month. At other times, the cost of the buydown is treated as a traditional mortgage point. Although it may sound attractive, all borrowers should conduct a thorough analysis should to ensure that a buydown is economical in either situation. That's because some sellers and/or builders may increase the purchase price in order to make up for the difference in costs—especially in certain market conditions. Conditions for 2-1 buydowns vary by lender, and they may not be available through all state and federal mortgage programs. Buydowns may not be available through some state and federal mortgage programs. The 2-1 buydown is only available on fixed-rate Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans and only for new mortgages. So any adjustments or refinancing on existing mortgages don't qualify, and the terms may vary based on the lender. For example, a borrower who has an FHA loan could make a buydown payment to reduce the monthly mortgage for two years on a 15-year or 30-year term loan if a 2-1 buydown option is available. After the buydown period expires, the borrower must make the full monthly payments for the remaining 28 years of the term.

A 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgage (2/28 ARM) is a type of 30-year home loan that has an initial two-year fixed interest rate period. After this 2-year period, the rate floats based on an index rate plus a margin. The initial teaser rate is typically below the average rate of conventional mortgages, but the adjustable rate can subsequently rise significantly. Since banks don’t make much money on the initial teaser rate, 2/28 ARMs include hefty pre-payment penalties during the first two years. Key Takeaways 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) offer an introductory fixed rate for two years, after which the interest rate adjusts semi-annually for 28 more years. When ARMs adjust, interest rates change based on their marginal rates and the indexes to which they're tied. Homeowners generally enjoy lower mortgage payments during the introductory period but are subject to interest rate risk afterward. Understanding 2/28 Adjustable-Rate Mortgages The 2/28 ARMs became popular during the real estate boom of the early 2000s when soaring prices put conventional mortgage payments out of reach for many buyers. For example, a $300,000 conventional 30-year mortgage would carry monthly payments of $1,610. But a 2/28 ARM with an initial teaser rate of 3% would require monthly payments of just $1,265. Other ARM structures exist, such as the 5/1, 5/5, and 5/6 ARMs, which feature a five-year introductory period followed by a rate adjustment every five years or every six months, respectively. Notably, 15/15 ARMs adjust once after 15 years and then remain fixed for the remainder of the loan. Less common are the 2/28 and 3/27 ARMs. With the former, the fixed interest rate applies for only the first two years, followed by 28 years of adjustable rates; with the latter, the fixed rate is for three years, with adjustments in each of the following 27 years. In these cases, rates adjust semi-annually. Potential Pitfalls of 2/28 ARMs The potential catch-22 of a 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgage is that after two years the rate is adjusted every six months, typically upward, by an ARM margin over and above an index rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). 2/28 ARMs have some built-in safety features, such as a lifetime interest rate cap and limits on how much the rate can increase, or decrease, with each period. But even with caps, homeowners can face jaw-dropping payment spikes in volatile markets. In the example given above in the $300,000 30-year 3% ARM 2/28 loan, if after two-years the LIBOR is 2.7 and the margin is 1.5, the interest would increase by 4.2 percent, to a total of 7.2 percent. This 7.2% rate could be well above current conventional mortgage rates. The homeowner’s monthly payment would increase overnight by more than 60%, to $2,036. Many homeowners during the boom failed to understand how a seemingly small rate increase could dramatically boost their monthly payment. And even those who were fully aware of the risks viewed 2/28 ARMs as a short-term financing vehicle. The idea was to take advantage of the low teaser rate, then refinance after two years to either a conventional mortgage or, if their credit was not good enough for that, to a new adjustable mortgage. And, given the spiking real estate prices, kick the debt further down the road. To many, this made a certain amount of sense, since, after all, the borrower’s home equity was rising fast. Trouble came with the market collapse in 2008. Home values plummeted. Many owners of 2/28 ARMs found themselves unable to refinance, make their payments, or sell their homes for the value of the outstanding loan. The rash of foreclosures led to stricter loan standards. Today banks are more carefully evaluating a borrower’s ability to make adjustable-rate payments. Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

The 2,000 Investor Limit is a stipulation required by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) that mandates a company that exceeds 2,000 individual investors, and with more than $10 million in combined assets, must file its financials with the commission.﻿﻿ According to SEC rules, a company that meets these criteria has 120 days to file following its fiscal year's end. Key Takeaways The 2,000 investor limit or rule is a key threshold for private businesses that do not wish to disclose financial information for public consumption. A business with more than 2,000 distinct shareholders, totaling $10 million or more in capital, must file with the SEC even if it is a privately-held company. Congress raised the limit from 500 individual investors to 2,000 investors in 2016 as part of the JOBS and FAST Acts.﻿﻿ The increased investor limit has opened greater possibility for equity crowdfunding. Understanding the 2000 Investor Limit The 2,000 investor limit or rule is a key threshold for private businesses that do not wish to disclose financial information for public consumption. Congress raised the limit from 500 individual investors in 2016 as part of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act and Title LXXXV of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. The revised rules also specify a limit of 500 persons who are not accredited investors before public filing is required.﻿﻿ The prior threshold had been 500 holders of record without regard to accredited investor status. Congress began debating an increase in the limit in the wake of the 2008 recession and an explosion in online businesses (some of which complained that they were growing so fast that the disclosure rules had become a burden at too early a stage of their lifecycle). The JOBS Act also set up a separate registration threshold for banks and bank holding companies, allowing them to terminate the registration of securities or suspend reporting if that class of shares is held by less than 1,200 people. Investor Thresholds and Equity Crowdfunding The JOBS Act revisions to SEC rules helped facilitate the growth of crowdfunding platforms. These platforms are able to raise money from individual investors online without providing detailed financial data. The rules established limits on how much individuals can invest in SEC-approved crowdfunding platforms as a percent of the lesser of their annual income or net worth. The individual limits for crowdfunding, through an investment portal approved by the SEC, as of May 2017:﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ If either your annual income or your net worth is under $107,000, during any 12-month period, you can invest up to the greater of either $2,200 or 5 percent of the lesser of your annual income or net worth. If both your annual income and net worth are $107,000 or more during any 12-month period, you can invest up to 10 percent of your annual income or net worth, whichever is less, not to exceed $107,000. These calculations don't include the value of your home. Example For example, suppose that your annual income is $150,000 and your net worth is $80,000. JOBS Act crowdfunding rules allow you to invest the greater of $2,200—or 5% of $80,000 ($4,000)—during a 12-month period.﻿﻿ So in this case, you can invest $4,000 over a 12-month period.

The 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis was a contentious debate in Congress that occurred in July 2011 regarding the maximum amount of borrowing the federal government should be allowed to undertake. Key Takeaways The 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis was one of a series of recurrent debates over increasing the total size of the U.S. national debt. The crisis was brought about by massive increases in federal spending following the Great Recession. In 2008, the federal budget deficit stood at $458.6 billon, which widened to $1.4 trillion the following year as the government spent heavily to boost the economy.﻿﻿ To resolve the crisis, Congress passed a law that increased the debt ceiling by $2.4 trillion.﻿﻿ Understanding the 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis The federal government has rarely achieved a balanced budget and its budget deficit ballooned following the 2007-08 Financial Crisis and the Great Recession. In the 2008 fiscal year, the deficit stood at $458.6 billon, widening to $1.4 trillion in 2009 as the government engaged in a massive fiscal policy response to the economic downturn.﻿﻿ Between 2008 and 2010, Congress raised the debt ceiling from $10.6 trillion to $14.3 trillion.﻿﻿ Then in 2011, as the economy showed early signs of recovery and federal debt approached its limit once again, negotiations began in Congress to balance spending priorities against the ever-rising debt burden. Heated debate ensued, pitting proponents of spending and debt against fiscal conservatives. Pro-debt politicians argued that failing to raise the limit would require immediate cuts to spending already authorized by Congress, which could result in late, partial, or missed payments to Social Security and Medicare recipients, government employees, and government contractors. Moreover, they asserted the Treasury could suspend interest payments on existing debt rather than withhold funds committed to federal programs. The prospect of cutting back on already promised spending was labeled a crisis by debt proponents. On the other hand, the specter of a technical default on existing Treasury debt roiled financial markets. Fiscal conservatives argued that any debt limit increase should come with constraints on the growth of federal spending and debt accumulation. Outcome of the 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis Congress resolved the debt ceiling crisis by passing the Budget Control Act of 2011, which became law on August 2, 2011.﻿﻿ This act allowed the debt ceiling to be raised by $2.4 trillion in two phases. In the first phase, a $400 billion increase would occur immediately, followed by another $500 billion unless Congress disapproved it. The second phase allowed for an increase of between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion, also subject to Congressional disapproval. In return, the act included $900 billion in slowdowns in planned spending increases over a 10-year period and established a special committee to discuss additional spending cuts.﻿﻿ In effect, the legislation raised the debt ceiling from $14.3 trillion to $16.4 trillion by January 27, 2012.﻿﻿ Following the passage of the act, Standard and Poor's took the radical step of downgrading the United States long-term credit rating from AAA to AA+, even though the U.S. did not default. The credit rating agency cited the unimpressive size of deficit reduction plans relative to the likely future prospects for politically driven spending and debt accumulation.﻿﻿ Debt Approval Process Leading to the 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to borrow money. Before 1917, this power was exercised by Congress authorizing the Treasury to borrow specified amounts of debt to fund limited expenses, such as war-time military spending that would be repaid after the end of hostilities. This kept the national debt directly linked to authorized spending.﻿﻿ In 1917, Congress imposed a limit on federal debt as well as individual issuance limits. In 1939, Congress gave the Treasury more flexibility in how it managed the overall structure of federal debt, giving it an aggregate limit to work within.﻿﻿ However, by delegating debt management authority to the Treasury, Congress was able to break the direct connection between authorized spending and the debt that finances it. While allowing greater flexibility to raise spending, this practice also created a need for Congress to repeatedly raise the debt limit when spending threatens to overrun available credit. Due to occasional political resistance to the idea of continually expanding the federal debt, this process of raising the debt limit has at times engendered controversy, which occurred during the 2011 Debt Ceiling Crisis.

Article Reviewed on January 06, 2021 Learn about our Financial Review Board Charles Potters Updated Jan 6, 2021 What Is the 25% Rule? There are two common usages of the term ""25% rule"": The 25% rule is the concept that a local government's long-term debt should not exceed 25% of its annual budget. Any debt beyond this threshold is considered excessive and poses a potential risk, as the municipality may have trouble servicing the debt. The 25% rule also refers to a technique for determining royalties which stipulates that a party selling a product or service based on another party's intellectual property must pay that party a royalty of 25% of the gross profit made from the sale, before taxes. The 25% rule also commonly applies to trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other forms of intellectual property. Key Takeaways The 25% rule is a heuristic that can refer to either public finance or intellectual property law. In public finance, the 25% rule prescribes that a public entity’s total debt should not exceed one-quarter of its annual budget. In intellectual property, the 25% rule suggests the reasonable royalty that a license should pay an intellectual property holder on profits. Understanding the 25% Rule In both uses of the term, the 25% rule is more a matter of customary practice or heuristic (i.e., a rule of thumb), rather than an absolute or optimal threshold, or a strict legal requirement. In the public finance setting, the 25% rule is a rough guideline for fiscal planning based on the confidence of bondholders and credit rating agencies. In the intellectual property arena, the 25% rule evolved from the customary rates negotiated between intellectual property holders and licensees. 25% Rule for Municipal Debt Local or state governments looking to fund projects through municipal bond issues have to make assumptions about the revenues they expect to bring in, often through taxation or projects like toll roads, which in turn will allow them to support bond payments. If revenue falls short of expectations, those municipalities may not be able to make bond payments, which can cause them to default on their obligations and hurt their credit rating. Municipal bondholders want to make sure that the issuing authority has the capacity to pay, which can be jeopardized by getting too deep in debt. Bondholders are thus cautious about purchasing bonds from local or state governments that are in violation of the 25% rule. Tax-exempt private activity bonds—bonds issued by municipalities on behalf of private or non-profit organizations—also have a 25% rule applied to the proceeds from the bonds. This rule states that no more than 25% of bond proceeds may be used for land acquisition. 25% Rule for Intellectual Property Patent or trademark owners use the 25% rule as a yardstick for defining a reasonable amount of royalty payments. The rule assumes that a licensee should retain at most 75% of the profits of a patented product given that s/he took on the bulk of the risks of developing the product and bringing the intellectual property to the market. The patent owner takes the remainder as a license royalty. Setting the value of intellectual property is a complex matter. Although royalties are typically assessed against revenues, the 25% rule applies to profits. Furthermore, the 25% rule does not closely define what ""gross profit"" includes, which creates ambiguity in the valuation calculation. Because it's a simple rule, it does not take into account the costs associated with marketing the product. For example, the holder of a copyright will receive a 25% royalty, though the party doing the selling usually incurs the cost of attracting demand in the market through advertising. In the 2011 court case of Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp, the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the 25 percent rule may not be used as a starting point for a patent damage analysis bound for the courtroom. The appeals court concluded that the rule does not rise to an admissible level of evidence and may not be relied upon in a patent lawsuit in federal court. While the 25% rule may still be used by other parties in estimating a proposed patent royalty, it should not be considered a legal mandate.

A 12B-1 plan is a plan structured by mutual fund companies for the distribution of funds through intermediaries. 12B-1 plans provide mapping for the partnerships between distributors and intermediaries who help to ensure the sale of a fund. Sales commission schedules and 12B-1 distribution expenses are the primary components driving a 12B-1 plan. Understanding the 12B-1 Plan 12B-1 plans facilitate the partnerships between distributors and intermediaries offering mutual fund shares. 12B-1 plans are primarily focused on open-end mutual funds, which have multiple class structures for sales charges and distribution expenses. Mutual fund companies consider two types of 12B-1 charges in their 12B-1 plans, sales commissions, and 12B-1 expenses. Sales Commissions Sales commission schedules are structured to provide compensation to intermediaries for transacting mutual funds. These partnerships can help to increase demand for funds by being marketed from a full-service broker-dealer who facilitates the transaction for a sales load fee. These fees are paid to the broker and are not associated with annual fund operating expenses. Sales loads are structured to vary across share classes. Share classes can include front-end, back-end, and level-load sales charges. These sales charges are associated with individual retail share classes which typically include Class A, B, and C shares.﻿﻿ 12B-1 Expenses 12B-1 expenses paid from the mutual fund to distributors and intermediaries are also a key part of a 12B-1 plan. To market and distribute open-end mutual fund shares, mutual fund companies work with distributors to get their funds listed with discount brokerages and financial advisor platforms. Distributors help fund companies partner with the full-service brokers that transact their funds at the agreed-upon sales load schedule. Mutual fund companies will pay 12B-1 fees from a mutual fund to compensate distributors.﻿﻿ In some cases, funds may also be structured with a low-level load that is paid to financial advisors annually during the course of an investor's holding period. Financial industry legislation typically restricts 12B-1 fees to 1% of the current value of the investment on an annual basis, but fees generally fall somewhere between 0.25% and 1%. In most cases, fund companies will have higher 12B-1 fees on share classes paying a lower sales charge, and lower 12B-1 fees on share classes with higher sales charges. This helps to balance out the compensation paid to intermediary brokers while also providing for payment to distribution partners.﻿﻿ Disclosure Mutual fund companies are required to provide full disclosure on their sales load schedules and 12B-1 annual fund expenses in the fund’s prospectus. The prospectus is one aspect of documentation required for the mutual fund’s registration and is also the key offering document providing information on the fund for investors.﻿﻿ 12B-1 plans and any changes to their expense structuring must be approved by the fund’s board of directors and amended in its prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

I know she’s anxious and easily overwhelmed but it hurts.” In the same period, Janelle has been through a lot of upheaval: changing jobs twice and moving from her rented shared house in London back to her mum’s in Sheffield to save money. Life has always been prone to changing fast. Even before coronavirus, you could wake up to find everything you know turned on its head: people we love die, relationships end, companies fold. But the last 12 months have exposed more people than ever to the inherent uncertainty of human existence. Some of our friendships have changed and we feel it for better and for worse; but the true extent of any long-term changes to our relationships are still revealing themselves. During the first lockdown of 2020, social scientists in France carried out a large-scale study of 16,000 people to assess the impact of the highly restrictive lockdown there. The participants skewed towards women who had attended higher education. A key impact of lockdown on their friendships, the researchers found, was what they called “ relationship funnelling”. This was a process whereby some friendships were prioritised and even strengthened through care and increased communication, while others just “fizzled out”. In a (hopefully) long life of many decades, the pandemic will one day seem like a blip for friendships that had already lasted longer than any lockdown. Nonetheless, those who responded to the survey said that this period had severely tested and, in some cases, transformed their friendships. Janelle is feeling this. “I know lockdown has shrunk all of our worlds but it feels hard not to take it personally that my friend is now basically uncontactable. She rarely replies to my messages now, it feels like we have really drifted. It feels like such a loss.” I know lockdown has shrunk all of our worlds but it feels hard not to take it personally that my friend is now basically uncontactable. Twenty-six-year-old Emma* from Leeds has had a similar experience. “My best friend and I have always been like sisters but in the first lockdown she started a new relationship and ended up moving in with him due to the restrictions. She now lives really far away from me and I feel like we have completely drifted apart. I’m single and, honestly, I feel like we have been growing apart because she stopped checking in and went into her own bubble with her boyfriend.” This has caused Emma to feel left out and left behind. “She seems settled in her new life now and I’m not a huge part of it anymore.” For young women in particular — a demographic which has been sold the idea that while lovers come and go, our friendships are forever — these shifts and drifts can be particularly painful and difficult to navigate. The seed of this expectation was planted when, in Sex and the City, Carrie and co. suggested that they, rather than men, could be each other’s soulmates. But just as romantic relationships let us down, so too can friendships. This is particularly true at a time when we — all of us — have been changed in some way by the experience of living through a pandemic. The distances between us as we come out of this lockdown are not only geographical. Some people have had children, changed their career, lost their career. And while some have started relationships, others have ended them. If our friendships have changed perhaps it is because we, too, have completely changed. Clinical psychologist and author of The Key To Calm, Linda Blair, says it’s important to realise that you might not be coming out of this as the same person who went into it. “Whether we enjoyed the experience or not, we have been forced to rethink our lives,” Linda explains. “That has, for some people, been a wonderful thing but, for others, it has been horrible. I really caution people to take their time with their friends as we emerge; what you think about your friendships as you’ve experienced them in such pressurised circumstances is not necessarily a reflection of your normal relationship with those people.” We must try to keep an open mind, Linda advises: treat our social interactions now as fact-finding missions to see how we feel in our friendships. Maybe they won’t be the same but perhaps we can meet one another with a new level of understanding. “Ask people questions about themselves,” she says, “see if you can get to know them again, renavigate your relationship. To be so intolerant as not to forgive people for how they have behaved under unprecedented circumstances of which we had no warning would be to cancel out some of your own behaviours. Think back to how stressed you have been and give everybody you can bear to give a chance, a chance.” I’m single and, honestly, I feel like we have been growing apart because she stopped checking in and went into her own bubble with her boyfriend. However, Linda adds, there are exceptions. “If someone has been truly harmful and poisonous, it’s okay to say goodbye to them.” She would define this as someone being “consistently and deliberately hurtful” to you. Over the last year, 29-year-old Kaya* from the southeast of England has done exactly that. She realised that her best friend was, as she puts it, “toxic” and has deliberately phased her out to preserve her own mental health. “Before the pandemic, we were very close and used to tell each other everything. We’d always be texting or tagging one another in memes. I’d call her my best friend — the person I’d run to in a crisis,” Kaya explains. “Our friendship wasn’t perfect, though. She would sometimes try to undermine me (for example if I’d achieved something notable at work) and sometimes she would comment on my clothes or makeup in a negative way. But she’s always been brutally honest and I just put that down to her being a November Sagittarius.” Everything changed when Kaya’s boyfriend broke up with her during the first lockdown. This was the last time she saw her former friend. “Although she came to support me, she gave me some really awful advice and I felt like she was trying to make the situation worse or stir trouble. Then the second lockdown hit and spending time apart from her made me realise that I felt drained whenever I talked to her and she made me feel bad about myself.” It was only when she spent time alone that Kaya feels she was able to reflect on the friendship. Lockdown, she says, taught her how to “protect” her “peace of mind” and with that came the steady realisation that this friend made her feel anxious. She began to reflect that her friend used to make unkind comments about her appearance: “She used to comment on the way I look or do my makeup.” On top of that, she would belittle her achievements at work: “She would actually laugh at them.” For Kaya, having the space to drift apart slowly has been hugely beneficial. She says she has surrounded herself with other friends who make her feel positive. “I don’t think this would have happened without the pandemic!” she reflects. “I think we would still be meeting up regularly for dinner and drinks and each time I’d probably come away feeling crappy and the cycle would continue. We texted each other a happy Christmas but I haven’t spoken to her since and have no desire to, to be honest. Sometimes friendships come to a natural end.” Some rifts will be irreparable and others, in time, will heal. “I like to think of friendships as an onion,” Linda says. “We have inner layers and outer layers. The next few months — and I really do mean months because this is a process — are about deciding who we allow to remain in the inner layers and who needs to go to the outer layers of only saying hi if we see them in the street.” I spoke to tens of people for this article, all of whom had similar stories. They all felt a sense of loss and some described themselves as grieving for how their friendships had changed. Our world has changed, so it follows that we have evolved and adapted too. Whatever we do next, Linda says that kindness and compassion are key. “Slow down,” she adds, “take your time and think about what you want from your friends.” If it still feels hopeless, remember that there are people out there who you haven’t met yet. People who have also worked on themselves during this time and will be looking to make new connections. “I’ve recently started using Bumble BFF,” Emma tells me. “I was really nervous about it but it’s been so helpful!

The 130-30 strategy, often called a long/short equity strategy, refers to an investing methodology used by institutional investors. A 130-30 designation implies using a ratio of 130% of starting capital allocated to long positions and accomplishing this by taking in 30% of the starting capital from shorting stocks. The strategy is employed in a fund for capital efficiency. It uses financial leverage by shorting poor performing stocks and, with the cash received by shorting those stocks, purchasing shares that are expected to have high returns. Often, investors will mimic an index such as the S&P 500 when choosing stocks for this strategy. Key Takeaways This investing strategy makes use of shorting stocks and putting the cash from shorting those shares to work buying and holding the best-ranked stocks for a designated period. These strategies tend to work well for limiting the drawdown that comes in investing. They do not appear to keep up with major averages in total returns but do have better risk-adjusted returns. Understanding the 130-30 Strategy To engage in a 130-30 strategy, an investment manager might rank the stocks used in the S&P 500 from best to worse on expected return, as signaled by past performance. A manager will use a number of data sources and rules for ranking individual stocks. Typically, stocks are ranked according to some set selection criteria (for example, total returns, risk-adjusted performance or relative strength) over a designated look-back period of six months or one year. The stocks are then ranked best to worst. From the best ranking stocks, the manager would invest 100% of the portfolio's value and short sell the bottom ranking stocks, up to 30% of the portfolio's value. The cash earned from the short sales would be reinvested into top-ranking stocks, allowing for greater exposure to the higher ranking stocks. 130-30 Strategy and Shorting Stocks The 130-30 strategy incorporates short sales as a significant part of its activity. Shorting a stock entails borrowing securities from another party, most often a broker, and agreeing to pay an interest rate as a fee. A negative position is subsequently recorded in the investor’s account. The investor then sells the newly acquired securities on the open market at the current price and receives the cash for the trade. The investor waits for the securities to depreciate and then re-purchases them at a lower price. At this point, the investor returns the purchased securities to the broker. In a reverse activity from first buying and then selling securities, shorting still allows the investor to profit. Short selling is much riskier than investing in long positions in securities; thus, in a 130-30 investment strategy, a manager will put more emphasis on long positions than short positions. Short-selling puts an investor into a position of unlimited risk and a capped reward. For example, if an investor shorts a stock trading at $30, the most she can gain is $30 (minus fees), while the most she can lose is infinite since the stock can technically increase in price forever. Hedge funds and mutual fund firms have begun offering investment vehicles in the way of private equity funds, mutual funds, or even exchange-traded funds that follow variations of the 130-30 strategy. In general, these instruments have lower volatility than benchmark indexes but often fail to achieve greater total returns. By some estimates, more than $100 billion worldwide have been invested in these types of strategies.

Economists and real estate investors use the term 18-hour city to describe a mid-size city with attractive amenities, higher-than-average population growth, and a lower cost of living and cost of doing business than the biggest urban areas. The 18-hour city generally has a population of under one million, making it a second-tier city. Eighteen-hour cities in the U.S. are increasingly seen as viable alternatives for investment and living to the Big Six markets of Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C that make up America's first-tier or 24-hour cities. Understanding the 18-Hour City While loosely defined, the term 18-hour city most often refers to a city that has public services, amenities and job opportunities that are comparable in quality to those in the big six markets. Key Takeaways Eighteen-hour cities are vibrant smaller metro areas that are proving attractive to new residents, entrepreneurs and investors. They boast lower living costs along with solid infrastructure and appealing amenities. Many have emerged as alternatives to big cities for starting or relocating a business or investing in real estate. Unlike the biggest cities, most of their services and amenities don't operate on a 24-hour basis. However, they boast comparable advantages, including solid public transportation systems, modern infrastructure and strong economies. Housing prices are moderate in comparison. The 18-Hour City Advantage Eighteen-hour cities have emerged as an attractive alternative to big cities for starting a new business, relocating an existing one, or investing in real estate. They typically feature lower capitalization rate compression, meaning property values tend to remain stable rather than spiking up or down significantly. Like first-tier cities, 18-hour cities often boast low real estate vacancy rates along with favorable supply concentrations, rental growth and absorption trends—all indicators of long-term real estate investment potential. Aside from the numbers, Forbes.com cites a distinctive and lovable culture as a key factor in creating and maintaining a vibrant 18-hour city: ""Austin is the live music capital of the world. Denver and the Research Triangle are outdoor meccas. Portland is just plain weird (and residents would like to keep it that way."" One perceived downside is the increased risk inherent in cities that do not have the established track record of primary market cities. Examples of 18-Hour Cities in the U.S. CrowdStreet, a site for crowd-sourced real estate investments, cites Austin, Denver, and Nashville as recent stars among 18-hour cities. In 2020, it identified Charleston, South Carolina, as the next big success story in the category. The stars among 18-hour cities are a draw for millennials turned off by big-city obstacles. Realtor.com identified its top metropolitan areas for 2020 and beyond, with all of its top five picks squarely in the 18-hour city category. They include Boise, Idaho; Mc-Allen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Columbia, South Carolina. The National Real Estate Investor website chose Charleston, Kansas City, and Columbus, Ohio, based on their stellar growth in jobs. Follow the Millennials These and other frequently-cited 18-hour city stars have become targets for millennials whose goal is launching or advancing their careers. They are characterized by the availability of recreation and entertainment opportunities that extend well beyond what the typical second-tier affords. Employers are drawn to 18-hour cities because doing business is less expensive in these markets and this, in turn, attracts large numbers of job seekers and entrepreneurs.

Article Reviewed on July 01, 2020 Learn about our Financial Review Board Lea D. Uradu Updated Jul 1, 2020 What Is the 183-Day Rule? The 183-day rule is used by most countries to determine if someone should be considered a resident for tax purposes. In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service uses 183 days as a threshold in the ""substantial presence test,"" which determines whether people who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should still be considered residents for taxation. Key Takeaways The 183-day rule refers to criteria used by many countries to determine if they should tax someone as a resident. The 183rd day marks a majority of the year. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service uses a more complicated formula, including a portion of days from the previous two years as well as the current year. Understanding the 183-Day Rule The 183rd day of the year marks a majority of the days in a year, and for this reason countries around the world use the 183-day threshold to broadly determine whether to tax someone as a resident. These include Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, for example. Generally, this means that if you spent 183 days or more in the country during a given year you are considered a tax resident for that year. The IRS and the 183-Day Rule However, the IRS uses a more complicated formula to reach 183 days and determine whether someone passes the substantial presence test. To pass the test, and thus be subject to U.S. taxes, the person in question must: Have been physically present at least 31 days during the current year and; Present 183 days during the three-year period that includes the current year and the two years immediately preceding it. Those days are counted as: All of the days they were present during the current year One-third of the days they were present during the previous year One-sixth of the days present two years previously Other IRS Terms and Conditions The IRS generally considers someone to have been present in the U.S. on a given day if they spent any part of a day there. But there are some exceptions. Days that do not count as days of presence include: Days that you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico, if you do so regularly Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours while in transit between two other countries Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are there U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Strictly speaking, the 183-day rule does not apply to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. U.S. citizens are required to file tax returns regardless of their country of residence or the source of their income. However, they may exclude at least part of their overseas earned income (up to $105,900 in 2019) from taxation provided they meet a physical presence test in the foreign country and paid taxes there. To meet the physical presence test, the person needs to be present in the country for 330 days in 12 months. U.S. Tax Treaties and Double Taxation The U.S. has tax treaties with other countries to determine jurisdiction for income tax purposes and to avoid double taxation of their citizens. These agreements contain provisions for the resolution of conflicting claims of residence.

Nikki was singing and dancing while throwing weeds up in the air. Seligman, on the other hand, was grumpy and becoming increasingly annoyed. He yelled. And his daughter walked off, upset.
