Healthcare, and Manufacturing Using AWS Learn how Siemens used AWS to adapt its culture, encourage innovation, and drive results for its business. Learn More Pioneering Across Industries Siemens is a more than 170-year-old company that started with an idea for improving the telegraph machine. Since its founding, the company has become a transformational leader across the energy, healthcare, and manufacturing industries. Democratizing Innovation Siemens encourages a culture of experimentation to discover new business opportunities and realize untapped customer value. The company uses AWS to adopt more agile development processes, including decentralized development teams, democratized data, and startup-like working methods. Continuing a Tradition of Transformation Siemens’ cultural transformation has delivered business results. These include bringing industrial IOT to railways and factories, developing intelligent building infrastructure, and using machine learning in its cybersecurity platform. Financial Services FICO Uses AWS to Innovate Faster, Reduce Costs, and Expand Global Reach Learn how FICO used AWS to develop products and deploy them to market faster. Learn More Betting Big on the Cloud For years, FICO lacked the agility to quickly develop and deploy its solutions to the market. New products sometimes took years to create and deliver. Seeking to focus on implementing software more efficiently, FICO turned to AWS. Breaking the Financial High Score FICO chose AWS as its cloud provider in part because of its built-in security. AWS also offered the necessary experience to help FICO navigate its increasingly complex regulatory and compliance requirements. Investing in Innovation Using AWS, FICO can deliver solutions in a matter of hours instead of weeks. FICO developers now have more time to build and enhance products instead of provisioning and managing servers. Fitness Peloton Powers Connected, At-Home Fitness Community Using AWS Learn how the global interactive fitness platform is growing its business and serving its members better using AWS. Learn More Transforming Home Fitness Peloton was founded in 2012 by a team of five people, and launched on Kickstarter in 2013. The company was born on AWS and delivered its first bike in 2014. In seven years, Peloton has grown to more than 1.4 million members who collectively have ridden hundreds of million of virtual miles. Powering Communities at Scale Peloton uses AWS to power the leaderboard in its live-streamed and on-demand fitness classes, and it requires high elasticity, low latency, and real-time processing to deliver customizable rider data for the community of more than 1.4 million members riding together from their homes. Launching New Features to Serve Members Better Using AWS, Peloton can quickly test and launch new features to improve the unique experience of home-based community fitness. Real Estate Zillow Transforms Real Estate Using AWS Zillow helped bring the real estate industry online, then reinvented the home-search process using AWS Cloud. Using AWS, Zillow delivers accurate home data to buyers, sellers, and renters, allowing them to make informed decisions in fast-paced markets. Learn More Growing Demand for Speed and Scale When Zillow created its home-valuation tool—Zestimate—nearly 15 years ago, it had to develop an on-premises machine learning framework to process an array of data. But, as its popularity and complexity grew, Zillow needed a better way to deliver Zestimates on nearly 100 million homes across the country. Faster, More Dynamic Home Valuations Zillow moved its Zestimate framework to AWS, giving it the speed and scale to deliver home valuations in near-real time.
