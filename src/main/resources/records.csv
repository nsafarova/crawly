Can’t remember your password? You’ll need to reset it. Here's how to do that: Go to the I’ve forgotten my password page. When requested, enter the email you used to register with the BBC. (If you registered with a fake email, you won’t be able to change your password, so you’ll need to register for a new account.) We’ll then send you an email with a link to reset your password.

Be sure to remember your new password for next time, but don't write it down anywhere in case someone finds it. Can’t find the email? Check your junk or spam folder. It might have been put in there by an overzealous spam filter. Still can’t find it? Follow the steps above again to get a new email. Under 13? Sorry, but you can’t reset your password if you’ve forgotten it. Instead you’ll need to register for a new BBC account.
