Can’t remember your password? You’ll need to reset it. Here's how to do that: Go to the I’ve forgotten my password page. When requested, enter the email you used to register with the BBC. (If you registered with a fake email, you won’t be able to change your password, so you’ll need to register for a new account.) We’ll then send you an email with a link to reset your password. When you receive that email, click the link and you’ll be taken to a page where you can create a new password. Be sure to remember your new password for next time, but don't write it down anywhere in case someone finds it. Can’t find the email? Check your junk or spam folder. It might have been put in there by an overzealous spam filter. Still can’t find it? Follow the steps above again to get a new email. Under 13? Sorry, but you can’t reset your password if you’ve forgotten it. Instead you’ll need to register for a new BBC account.

Understanding Roth IRAs Opening a Roth IRA Are Roth IRAs Insured? What To Contribute to a Roth IRA? Who's Eligible for a Roth IRA? The Spousal Roth IRA Withdrawals: Qualified Withdrawals: Non-Qualified Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA What Is a Roth IRA? A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account (IRA) that allows qualified withdrawals on a tax-free basis provided certain conditions are satisfied. Established in 1997, it was named after William Roth, a former Delaware Senator.﻿﻿ Roth IRAs are similar to traditional IRAs, with the biggest distinction between the two being how they’re taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars; the contributions are not tax-deductible. But once you start withdrawing funds, the money is tax-free. Conversely, traditional IRA deposits are generally made with pretax dollars; you usually get a tax deduction on your contribution and pay income tax when you withdraw the money from the account during retirement.﻿﻿ This and other key differences make Roth IRAs a better choice than traditional IRAs for some retirement savers. Key Takeaways A Roth IRA is a special retirement account where you pay taxes on money going into your account, and then all future withdrawals are tax-free. Roth IRAs are best when you think your taxes will be higher in retirement than they are right now. You can't contribute to a Roth IRA if you make too much money. In 2021, the limit for singles is $140,000. For married couples, the limit is $208,000. The amount you can contribute changes periodically. In 2021, the contribution limit is $6,000 a year unless you are age 50 or older—in which case, you can deposit up to $7,000. Almost all brokerage ﬁrms, both physical and online, offer a Roth IRA. So do most banks and investment companies. Understanding Roth IRAs Similar to other qualified retirement plan accounts, the money invested within the Roth IRA grows tax-free. However, a Roth is less restrictive than other accounts in several ways. Contributions can continue to be made at any age, as long as the account holder has earned income.﻿﻿ The account holder can maintain the Roth IRA indefinitely; there are no required minimum distributions (RMDs) during their lifetime, as there is with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.﻿﻿ A Roth IRA can be funded from a number of sources: Regular contributions Spousal IRA contributions Transfers Rollover contributions Conversions All regular Roth IRA contributions must be made in cash (which includes checks); they can't be in the form of securities or assets. However, a variety of investment options exist within a Roth IRA once the funds are contributed, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, ETFs, CDs, and money market funds.﻿﻿ The IRS limits how much can be deposited in any type of IRA, adjusting the amounts periodically. The contribution limits are the same for traditional and Roth IRAs.﻿﻿ $6,000 The maximum annual contribution an individual can make to a Roth IRA in 2020 remains the same in 2021. Those 50 years old and up can contribute up to $7,000.﻿﻿ Opening a Roth IRA A Roth IRA must be established with an institution that has received IRS approval to offer IRAs. These include banks, brokerage companies, federally insured credit unions, and savings and loan associations. Generally, individuals open IRAs with brokers. A Roth IRA can be established at any time. However, contributions for a tax year must be made by the IRA owner’s tax-filing deadline, which is generally April 15 of the following year. Tax-filing extensions do not apply.﻿﻿ On March 17, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that the federal income tax filing due date for all taxpayers for the 2020 tax year will be automatically extended from April 15, 2021, to May 17, 2021. This pushes other tax-related deadlines back as well; for example, the deadline to make IRA contributions is usually April 15, but taxpayers will have extra time this year. Taxpayers impacted by the 2021 winter storms in Texas will have until June 15, 2021, to file various individual and business tax returns, make tax payments, and make 2020 IRA contributions. (The IRS's extension for victims of the 2021 winter storms was announced on Feb. 22, 2021.) There are two basic documents that must be provided to the IRA owner when an IRA is established: The IRA disclosure statement The IRA adoption agreement and plan document These provide an explanation of the rules and regulations under which the Roth IRA must operate, and establish an agreement between the IRA owner and the IRA custodian/trustee. Not all financial institutions are created equal. Some IRA providers have an expansive list of investment options, while others are more restrictive. Almost every institution has a different fee structure for your Roth IRA, which can have a significant impact on your investment returns. Your risk tolerance and investment preferences are going to play a role in choosing a Roth IRA provider. If you plan on being an active investor and making lots of trades, you want to find a provider that has lower trading costs. Certain providers even charge you an account inactivity fee if you leave your investments alone for too long. Some providers have more diverse stock or exchange traded fund offerings than others; it all depends on the type of investments you want in your account. Pay attention to the specific account requirements as well. Some providers have higher minimum account balances than others. If you plan on banking with the same institution, see if your Roth IRA account comes with additional banking products. If you're looking at opening a Roth at a bank or brokerage where you already have an account, see whether existing customers receive any IRA fee discounts. 2:11 Roth IRA Vs. Traditional IRA Are Roth IRAs Insured? If your account is located at a bank, be aware IRAs fall under a different insurance category than conventional deposit accounts. Therefore, coverage for IRA accounts is not as robust. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) still offers insurance protection up to $250,000 for traditional or Roth IRA accounts, but account balances are combined rather than viewed individually. For example, if the same banking customer has a certificate of deposit held within a traditional IRA with a value of $200,000 and a Roth IRA held in a savings account with a value of $100,000 at the same institution, the account holder has $50,000 of vulnerable assets without FDIC coverage. What Can You Contribute to a Roth IRA? The IRS dictates not only how much money you can deposit in a Roth, but the type of money you can deposit. Basically, you can only contribute earned income to a Roth IRA. For individuals working for an employer, compensation that is eligible to fund a Roth IRA includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other amounts paid to the individual for the services they perform. It's generally any amount shown in Box 1 of the individual's Form W-2. For a self-employed individual or a partner in a partnership, compensation is the individual’s net earnings from their business, less any deduction allowed for contributions made to retirement plans on the individual’s behalf and further reduced by 50% of the individual’s self-employment taxes. Money related to divorce—alimony, child support, or in a settlement—can also be contributed. So what sort of funds aren't eligible? The list includes: Rental income or other profits from property maintenance Interest income Pension or annuity income Stock dividends and capital gains You can never contribute more to your IRA than you earned in that tax year. And, as previously mentioned, you receive no tax deduction for the contribution—although you may be able to take a Saver's Tax Credit of 10%, 20%, or 50% of the deposit, depending on your income and life situation. Who's Eligible for a Roth IRA? Anyone who has taxable income can contribute to a Roth IRA—as long as they meet certain requirements concerning filing status and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Those whose annual income is above a certain amount, which the IRS adjusts periodically, become ineligible to contribute.﻿﻿ The chart below shows the figures for 2020 and 2021.﻿﻿ Do You Qualify for a Roth? Category Income Range for 2020 Contribution Income Range for 2021 Contribution Married and filing a joint tax return Full: Less than $196,000 Partial: From $196,000 to less than $206,000 Full: Less than $198,000 Partial: From $198,000 to less than $208,000 Married, filing a separate tax return, lived with spouse at any time during the year Full: $0 Partial: Less than $10,000 Full: $0 Partial: Less than $10,000 Single, head of household, or married filing separately without living with spouse at any time during the year Full: Less than $124,000 Partial: From $124,000 to less than $139,000 Full: Less than $125,000 Partial: From $125,000 to less than $140,000 ﻿﻿ These individuals must use a formula to determine the maximum amount they may contribute to a Roth IRA. An individual who earns less than the ranges shown for his or her appropriate category can contribute up to 100% of his or her compensation or the contribution limit, whichever is less. Individuals within the phase-out range must subtract their income from the maximum level and then divide that by the phase-out range to determine the percentage of $6,000 they are allowed to contribute. The Spousal Roth IRA One way a couple can boost their contributions: the spousal Roth IRA. An individual may fund a Roth IRA on behalf of their married partner who earns little or no income. Spousal Roth IRA contributions are subject to the same rules and limits as regular Roth IRA contributions. The spousal Roth IRA must be held separately from the Roth IRA of the individual making the contribution, as Roth IRAs cannot be joint accounts.﻿﻿ For an individual to be eligible to make a spousal Roth IRA contribution, the following requirements must be met: The couple must be married and file a joint tax return. The individual making the spousal Roth IRA contribution must have eligible compensation. The total contribution for both spouses must not exceed the taxable compensation reported on their joint tax return. Contributions to one Roth IRA cannot exceed the contribution limits for one IRA (however, the two accounts allow the family to double their annual savings). Withdrawals: Qualified Distributions At any time, you may withdraw contributions from your Roth IRA, both tax- and penalty-free. If you take out only an amount equal to the sum you've put in, the distribution is not considered taxable income and is not subject to penalty, regardless of your age or how long it has been in the account. In IRS-speak, this is known as a qualified distribution. However, there's a catch when it comes to withdrawing account earnings—any returns the account has generated. For distribution of account earnings to be qualified, it must occur at least five years after the Roth IRA owner established and funded his/her first Roth IRA, and the distribution must occur under at least one of the following conditions: The Roth IRA holder is at least age 59½ when the distribution occurs. The distributed assets are used toward the purchase—or to build or rebuild—a first home for the Roth IRA holder or a qualified family member (the IRA owner's spouse, a child of the IRA owner or of the IRA owner's spouse, a grandchild of the IRA owner and/or of their spouse, a parent or other ancestor of the IRA owner or of their spouse). This is limited to $10,000 per lifetime. The distribution occurs after the Roth IRA holder becomes disabled. The assets are distributed to the beneficiary of the Roth IRA holder after the Roth IRA holder's death. The 5-Year Rule Withdrawal of earnings may be subject to taxes and/or a 10% penalty, depending on your age and whether you've met the 5-year rule. Here's a quick rundown. If you meet the 5-year rule: Under 59½: Earnings are subject to taxes and penalties. You may be able to avoid taxes and penalties if you use the money for a first-time home purchase (a $10,000-lifetime limit applies), if you have a permanent disability, or if you pass away (and your beneficiary takes the distribution). Age 59½ and older: No taxes or penalties. If you don’t meet the 5-year rule: Under 59½: Earnings are subject to taxes and penalties. You may be able to avoid the penalty (but not the taxes) if you use the money for a first-time home purchase (a $10,000-lifetime limit applies), qualified education expenses, unreimbursed medical expenses, if you have a permanent disability, or if you pass away (and your beneficiary takes the distribution). 59½ and older: Earnings are subject to taxes but not penalties. Roth withdrawals are made on a FIFO basis (first in, first out)—so any withdrawals made come from contributions first. Therefore, no earnings are considered touched until all contributions have been taken out first. Withdrawals: Non-Qualified Distributions A withdrawal of earnings that do not meet the above requirements is considered a non-qualified distribution and may be subject to income tax and/or a 10% early-distribution penalty. There may be exceptions, however, if the funds are used: For unreimbursed medical expenses. If the distribution is used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses for amounts that exceed 10% of the individual's adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year of the distribution. (That 10% number applies to withdrawals after 2012. Prior to that, it was 7.5% of the AGI.) To pay medical insurance. If the individual has lost his or her job. For qualified higher-education expenses. If the distribution goes toward qualified higher-education expenses of the Roth IRA owner and/or his or her dependents. These qualified education expenses are tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for the enrollment or attendance of a student at an eligible educational institution and must be used in the year of the withdrawal. For childbirth or adoption expenses. Up to $5,000, if made within one year of the event. Note that if you withdraw only the amount of your contributions made within the current tax year—including any earnings on those contributions—the contribution is reversed. For example, If you contribute $5,000 in the current year and those funds generate $500 in earnings, you can withdraw the $5,000 principal tax-free and penalty-free and the $500 gain will be treated as taxable income. Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA Whether or not a Roth IRA is more beneficial than a traditional IRA depends on the tax bracket of the filer, the expected tax rate at retirement, and personal preference. Individuals who expect to be in a higher tax bracket once they retire may find the Roth IRA more advantageous since the total tax avoided in retirement will be greater than the income tax paid in the present. Therefore, younger and lower-income workers may benefit the most from the Roth IRA. Indeed, by beginning to save with an IRA early in life, investors make the most of the snowballing effect of compound interest: Your investment and its earnings are reinvested and generate more earnings, which are reinvested, and so on. Consider opening a Roth over a traditional IRA if you are more interested in tax-free income when you retire than in a tax deduction now when you contribute. Of course, even if you expect to have a lower tax rate in retirement, you'll still enjoy a tax-free income stream from your Roth. Not the worst idea in the world. Those who don't need their Roth IRA assets in retirement can leave the money to accrue indefinitely and pass the assets to heirs tax-free upon death. Even better, while the beneficiary must take distributions from an inherited IRA, they can stretch out tax deferral by taking distributions for a decade and, in some specialized cases, for their lifetimes.﻿﻿ Traditional IRA beneficiaries, on the other hand, do pay taxes on the distributions. Also, a spouse can roll over an inherited IRA into a new account and not have to begin taking distributions until age 72. Some open or convert to Roth IRAs because they fear an increase in taxes in the future, and this account allows them to lock in the current tax rates on the balance of their conversions. Executives and other highly compensated employees who are able to contribute to a Roth retirement plan through their employers [for example, a Roth 401(k)] can also roll these plans into Roth IRAs with no tax consequence and then escape having to take mandatory minimum distributions when they turn 72.

Types of ETFs How to Buy and Sell ETFs Real-World Examples of ETFs Advantages and Disadvantages of ETFs ETF Creation and Redemption What Is an ETF? An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. A well-known example is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index. ETFs can contain many types of investments, including stocks, commodities, bonds, or a mixture of investment types. An exchange traded fund is a marketable security, meaning it has an associated price that allows it to be easily bought and sold. Key Takeaways An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock. ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds that only trade once a day after the market closes.﻿﻿ ETFs can contain all types of investments including stocks, commodities, or bonds; some offer U.S. only holdings, while others are international. ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions than buying the stocks individually. An ETF is called an exchange traded fund since it's traded on an exchange just like stocks. The price of an ETF’s shares will change throughout the trading day as the shares are bought and sold on the market. This is unlike mutual funds, which are not traded on an exchange, and trade only once per day after the markets close. Additionally, ETFs tend to be more cost-effective and more liquid when compared to mutual funds. An ETF is a type of fund that holds multiple underlying assets, rather than only one like a stock. Because there are multiple assets within an ETF, they can be a popular choice for diversification. An ETF can own hundreds or thousands of stocks across various industries, or it could be isolated to one particular industry or sector. Some funds focus on only U.S. offerings, while others have a global outlook. For example, banking-focused ETFs would contain stocks of various banks across the industry. Types of ETFs There are various types of ETFs available to investors that can be used for income generation, speculation, price increases, and to hedge or partly offset risk in an investor's portfolio. Below are several examples of the types of ETFs. Bond ETFs might include government bonds, corporate bonds, and state and local bonds—called municipal bonds. Industry ETFs track a particular industry such as technology, banking, or the oil and gas sector. Commodity ETFs invest in commodities including crude oil or gold. Currency ETFs invest in foreign currencies such as the Euro or Canadian dollar. Inverse ETFs attempt to earn gains from stock declines by shorting stocks. Shorting is selling a stock, expecting a decline in value, and repurchasing it at a lower price. Investors should be aware that many inverse ETFs are exchange traded notes (ETNs) and not true ETFs. An ETN is a bond but trades like a stock and is backed by an issuer like a bank. Be sure to check with your broker to determine if an ETN is a right fit for your portfolio. In the U.S., most ETFs are set up as open-ended funds and are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 except where subsequent rules have modified their regulatory requirements. Open-end funds do not limit the number of investors involved in the product. How to Buy and Sell ETFs ETFs trade through online brokers and traditional broker-dealers. You can view some of the top brokers in the industry for ETFs with Investopedia's list of the best brokers for ETFs. An alternative to standard brokers are robo-advisors like Betterment and Wealthfront who make use of ETFs in their investment products. Real-World Examples of ETFs Below are examples of popular ETFs on the market today. Some ETFs track an index of stocks creating a broad portfolio while others target specific industries. The SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is the oldest surviving and most widely known ETF tracks the S&P 500 Index. The iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) tracks the Russell 2000 small-cap index. The Invesco QQQ (QQQ) indexes the Nasdaq 100, which typically contains technology stocks. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) represents the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Sector ETFs track individual industries such as oil (OIH), energy (XLE), financial services (XLF), REITs (IYR), Biotech (BBH). Commodity ETFs represent commodity markets including crude oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG). Physically-Backed ETFs: The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) hold physical gold and silver bullion in the fund. Advantages and Disadvantages of ETFs ETFs provide lower average costs since it would be expensive for an investor to buy all the stocks held in an ETF portfolio individually. Investors only need to execute one transaction to buy and one transaction to sell, which leads to fewer broker commissions since there are only a few trades being done by investors. Brokers typically charge a commission for each trade. Some brokers even offer no-commission trading on certain low-cost ETFs reducing costs for investors even further. An ETF's expense ratio is the cost to operate and manage the fund. ETFs typically have low expenses since they track an index. For example, if an ETF tracks the S&P 500 index, it might contain all 500 stocks from the S&P making it a passively-managed fund and less time-intensive. However, not all ETFs track an index in a passive manner. Pros Access to many stocks across various industries Low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions. Risk management through diversification ETFs exist that focus on targeted industries Cons Actively-managed ETFs have higher fees Single industry focus ETFs limit diversification Lack of liquidity hinders transactions Actively-Managed ETFs There are also actively managed ETFs, where portfolio managers are more involved in buying and selling shares of companies and changing the holdings within the fund. Typically, a more actively managed fund will have a higher expense ratio than passively managed ETFs. It is important that investors determine how the fund is managed, whether it's actively or passively managed, the resulting expense ratio, and weigh the costs versus the rate of return to make sure it is worth holding. Indexed-Stock ETFs An indexed-stock ETF provides investors with the diversification of an index fund as well as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as little as one share since there are no minimum deposit requirements. However, not all ETFs are equally diversified. Some may contain a heavy concentration in one industry, or a small group of stocks, or assets that are highly correlated to each other. Dividends and ETFs While ETFs provide investors with the ability to gain as stock prices rise and fall, they also benefit from companies that pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of earnings allocated or paid by companies to investors for holding their stock. ETF shareholders are entitled to a proportion of the profits, such as earned interest or dividends paid, and may get a residual value in case the fund is liquidated. ETFs and Taxes An ETF is more tax-efficient than a mutual fund since most buying and selling occurs through an exchange and the ETF sponsor does not need to redeem shares each time an investor wishes to sell, or issue new shares each time an investor wishes to buy. Redeeming shares of a fund can trigger a tax liability so listing the shares on an exchange can keep tax costs lower. In the case of a mutual fund, each time an investor sells their shares they sell it back to the fund and incur a tax liability can be created that must be paid by the shareholders of the fund. ETFs Market Impact Since ETFs have become increasingly popular with investors, many new funds have been created resulting in low trading volumes for some of them. The result can lead to investors not being able to buy and sell shares of a low-volume ETF easily. Concerns have surfaced about the influence of ETFs on the market and whether demand for these funds can inflate stock values and create fragile bubbles. Some ETFs rely on portfolio models that are untested in different market conditions and can lead to extreme inflows and outflows from the funds, which have a negative impact on market stability. Since the financial crisis, ETFs have played major roles in market flash-crashes and instability. Problems with ETFs were significant factors in the flash crashes and market declines in May 2010, August 2015, and February 2018. ETF Creation and Redemption The supply of ETF shares is regulated through a mechanism known as creation and redemption, which involves large specialized investors, called authorized participants (APs). Creation When an ETF wants to issue additional shares, the AP buys shares of the stocks from the index—such as the S&P 500 tracked by the fund—and sells or exchanges them to the ETF for new ETF shares at an equal value. In turn, the AP sells the ETF shares in the market for a profit. The process of an AP selling stocks to the ETF sponsor, in return for shares in the ETF, is called creation. Creation When Shares Trade at a Premium Imagine an ETF that invests in the stocks of the S&P 500 and has a share price of $101 at the close of the market. If the value of the stocks that the ETF owns was only worth $100 on a per share basis, then the fund's price of $101 is trading at a premium to the fund's net asset value (NAV). The NAV is an accounting mechanism that determines the overall value of the assets or stocks in an ETF. An authorized participant has an incentive to bring the ETF share price back into equilibrium with the fund’s NAV. To do this, the AP will buy shares of the stocks that the ETF wants to hold in its portfolio from the market and sells them to the fund in return for shares of the ETF. In this example, the AP is buying stock on the open market worth $100 per share but getting shares of the ETF that are trading on the open market for $101 per share. This process is called creation and increases the number of ETF shares on the market. If everything else remains the same, increasing the number of shares available on the market will reduce the price of the ETF and bring shares in line with the NAV of the fund. Redemption Conversely, an AP also buys shares of the ETF on the open market. The AP then sells these shares back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for individual stock shares that the AP can sell on the open market. As a result, the number of ETF shares is reduced through the process called redemption. The amount of redemption and creation activity is a function of demand in the market and whether the ETF is trading at a discount or premium to the value of the fund's assets. Redemption When Shares Trade at a Discount Imagine an ETF that holds the stocks in the Russell 2000 small-cap index and is currently trading for $99 per share. If the value of the stocks the ETF is holding in the fund is worth $100 per share, then the ETF is trading at a discount to NAV. To bring the ETF’s share price back to its NAV, an AP will buy shares of the ETF on the open market and sell them back to the ETF in return for shares of the underlying stock portfolio. In this example, the AP is able to buy ownership of $100 worth of stock in exchange for ETF shares it bought for $99. This process is called redemption, and it decreases the supply of ETF shares on the market. When the supply of ETF shares is decreased, the price should rise and get closer to its NAV.

How 401(k) Plans Work Taking Withdrawals from a 401(k) Traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k) Special Considerations: When You Leave Your Jobs Frequently Asked Questions What Is a 401(k) Plan? A 401(k) plan is a tax-advantaged, defined-contribution retirement account offered by many employers to their employees. It is named after a section of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Workers can make contributions to their 401(k) accounts through automatic payroll withholding, and their employers can match some or all of those contributions. The investment earnings in a traditional 401(k) plan are not taxed until the employee withdraws that money, typically after retirement. In a Roth 401(k) plan, withdrawals can be tax-free. Key Takeaways A 401(k) plan is a company-sponsored retirement account that employees can contribute to. Employers may also make matching contributions. There are two basic types of 401(k)s—traditional and Roth—which differ primarily in how they're taxed. In a traditional 401(k), employee contributions reduce their income taxes for the year they are made, but their withdrawals are taxed. With a Roth, employees make contributions with post-tax income but can make withdrawals tax-free. For 2020, under the CARES Act, withdrawal rules and amounts were relaxed for those affected by COVID-19, and RMDs were suspended. How 401(k) Plans Work There are two basic types of 401(k) accounts: traditional 401(k)s and Roth 401(k)s, sometimes referred to as a ""designated Roth account."" The two are similar in many respects, but they are taxed in different ways. A worker can have either type of account or both types. Contributing to a 401(k) Plan A 401(k) is what's known as a defined-contribution plan. The employee and employer can make contributions to the account, up to the dollar limits set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By contrast, traditional pensions [not to be confused with traditional 401(k)s] are referred to as defined-benefit plans—the employer is responsible for providing a specific amount of money to the employee upon retirement.﻿﻿ In recent decades, 401(k) plans have become more plentiful, and traditional pensions increasingly rare, as employers have shifted the responsibility and risk of saving for retirement to their employees. Employees are also responsible for choosing the specific investments within their 401(k) accounts, from the selection their employer offers. Those offerings typically include an assortment of stock and bond mutual funds as well as target-date funds that hold a mixture of stocks and bonds appropriate in terms of risk for when that person expects to retire. They may also include guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) issued by insurance companies and sometimes the employer's own stock. Contribution Limits The maximum amount that an employee or employer can contribute to a 401(k) plan is adjusted periodically to account for inflation. As of 2020 and in 2021, the basic limits on employee contributions are $19,500 per year for workers under age 50 and $26,000 for those 50 and up (including the $6,500 catch-up contribution).﻿﻿ If the employer also contributes—or if the employee elects to make additional, non-deductible after-tax contributions to their traditional 401(k) account (if allowed by their plan)—the total employee/employer contribution for workers under 50 for 2021 is capped at $58,000, or 100% of employee compensation, whichever is lower. For those 50 and over, again for 2021, the limit is $64,500.﻿﻿ Employer Matching Employers who match their employee contributions use different formulas to calculate that match. A common example might be 50 cents or $1 for every dollar the employee contributes up to a certain percentage of salary. Financial advisors often recommend that employees try to contribute at least enough money to their 401(k) plans each to get the full employer match. Contributing to a Traditional and Roth 401(k) If they wish—and if their employer offers both choices—employees can split their contributions, putting some money into a traditional 401(k) and some into a Roth 401(k). However, their total contribution to the two types of accounts can't exceed the limit for one account (such as $19,500 (if you are under age 50) in 2020 and 2021).﻿﻿ Employer contributions can only go into a traditional 401(k) account—not a Roth—where they will be subject to tax upon withdrawal. Taking Withdrawals from a 401(k) Participants should remember that once their money is in a 401(k), it may be hard to withdraw without penalty. ""Make sure that you still save enough on the outside for emergencies and expenses you may have before retirement,"" says Dan Stewart, CFA®, president of Revere Asset Management Inc., in Dallas, Texas. ""Do not put all of your savings into your 401(k) where you cannot easily access it, if necessary."" The earnings in a 401(k) account are tax-deferred in the case of traditional 401(k)s and tax-free in the case of Roths. When the owner of a traditional 401(k) makes withdrawals, that money (which has never been taxed) will be taxed as ordinary income. Roth account owners (who have already paid income tax on the money they contributed to the plan) will owe no tax on their withdrawals, as long as they satisfy certain requirements.﻿﻿ Both traditional and Roth 401(k) owners must be at least age 59½—or meet other criteria spelled out by the IRS, such as being totally and permanently disabled—when they start to make withdrawals. Otherwise, they usually will face an additional 10% early-distribution penalty tax on top of any other tax they owe.﻿﻿ Required Minimum Distributions Both types of accounts are also subject to required minimum distributions, or RMDs. (Withdrawals are often referred to as ""distributions"" in IRS parlance.) After age 72, account owners must withdraw at least a specified percentage from their 401(k) plans, using IRS tables based on their life expectancy at the time (prior to 2020, the RMD age had been 70½ years old). If they are still working and the account is with their current employer, however, they may not have to take RMDs from that plan.﻿﻿ ﻿Note that distributions from a traditional 401(k) are taxable. Qualified withdrawals from a Roth 401(k) are not, but they do lose the tax-free growth of being within the 401(k) account. Roth IRAs, unlike Roth 401(k)s, are not subject to RMDs during the owner's lifetime. Traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k) When 401(k) plans first became available in 1978, companies and their employees had just one choice: the traditional 401(k). Then, in 2006, Roth 401(k)s arrived. Roths are named for former U.S. Senator William Roth of Delaware, the primary sponsor of the 1997 legislation that made the Roth IRA possible.﻿﻿ While Roth 401(k)s were a little slow to catch on, many employers now offer them. So the first decision employees often have to make is between Roth and traditional. As a general rule, employees who expect to be in a lower marginal tax bracket after they retire might want to opt for a traditional 401(k) and take advantage of the immediate tax break. On the other hand, employees who expect to be in a higher bracket might opt for the Roth so that they can avoid taxes later. For example, a Roth might be the right choice for a younger worker whose salary is relatively low now but likely to rise substantially over time. Also important—especially if the Roth has years to grow—is that there is no tax on withdrawals, which means that all the money the contributions earn over decades of being in the account is also not taxed. Since no one can predict what tax rates will be decades from now, neither type of 401(k) is a sure thing. For that reason many financial advisors suggest that people hedge their bets, putting some of their money into each. 1:57 Introduction To The 401(K) Special Considerations: When You Leave Your Job When an employee leaves a company where they have a 401(k) plan, they generally have four options: 1. Withdraw the money This is usually a bad idea unless the employee absolutely needs the cash for an urgent purpose, such as a medical bill. Not only will the money be taxable in the year it's withdrawn, but the employee may also be hit with the additional 10% early distribution tax unless they are over 59½, totally and permanently disabled, or meet the other IRS criteria for an exception to the rule.﻿﻿ This rule has been suspended for 2020 for those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted above. In the case of Roth IRAs, the employee's contributions may be withdrawn tax-free and without penalty at any time, but earnings will be taxable if the employee is under 59½ and has had the account for less than five years.﻿﻿ And even if the employee is able to withdraw the money tax-free, they will be diminishing their retirement savings, which they may regret later in life. 2. Roll it over into an IRA By moving the money into an IRA at, say, a brokerage firm or mutual fund company, the employee can avoid immediate taxes and maintain their account's tax-advantaged status. What's more, the employee is likely to have a wider range of investment choices in an IRA than with their employer's plan.﻿﻿ The IRS has relatively strict rules on rollovers and how they need to be accomplished, and running afoul of them can be costly. Typically, the financial institution that is in line to receive the money will be more than happy to help with the process and avoid any missteps. Funds withdrawn from your 401(k) must be rolled over to another retirement account within 60 days to avoid taxes and penalties. 3. Leave it with the old employer In many cases, employers will permit a departing employee to keep a 401(k) account in their old plan indefinitely, although the employee can't make any further contributions to it. This generally applies to accounts worth at least $5,000—in the case of smaller accounts, the employer may give the employee no choice but to move the money elsewhere. Leaving 401(k) money where it is can make sense if the old employer's plan is well managed, and the employee is satisfied with the investment choices it offers. The danger is that employees who change jobs over the course of their careers can leave a trail of old 401(k) plans and may forget about one or more of them. Their heirs might also be unaware of the existence of the accounts. 4. Move it to a new employer Some companies allow new employees to move an old 401(k) into their own plan. As with an IRA rollover, this can maintain the account's tax-deferred status and avoid immediate taxes. It could be a wise move if the employee isn't comfortable with making the investment decisions involved in managing a rollover IRA and would rather leave some of that work to the new plan's administrator. In addition, if the employee is nearing age 72, note that money that is in a 401(k) at one's current employer may not be subject to RMDs. Moving the money will protect more retirement assets under that umbrella. Frequently Asked Questions What is a 401(k) Plan and how does it work? A 401(k) Plan is a defined-contribution retirement account that allows employees to save a portion of their salary in a tax-advantaged manner. The money earned in a 401(k) Plan is not taxed until after the employee retires, at which time their income will typically be lower than during their working years. 401(k) Plans also allow employers to match a portion of the contributions made by the employee, helping to grow their retirement funds even faster. Is it worth having a 401(k) plan? Generally speaking, 401(k) plans can be a great way for employees to save for retirement. However, whether a 401(k) plan is the best option available will depend on the employee’s individual goals and circumstances. All else being equal, employees will have more to gain from participating in a 401(k) plan if their employer offers a more generous contribution-matching program. How much of my salary can I contribute into a 401(k) Plan? The amount that employees can contribute to their 401(k) Plan is adjusted each year to keep pace with inflation. In 2020 and 2021, the limit is $19,500 per year for workers under age 50 and $26,000 for those aged 50 and above. If the employee also benefits from matching contributions from their employer, then the combined contribution from both the employee and the employer is capped at the lesser of $58,000 or 100% of the employee’s compensation for the year.﻿﻿ Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
