Our Team Documents Contact What is Crawly? Crawly is a project dedicated to create an efficient and effective tool for data retrieval process. Deliverables? In the era of Big Data, how to retrieve the required information that exists on the web easily and efficiently has become a critical issue with the exponential growth of web pages. In terms of performance and scalability, web crawlers based on single machines get to their bottlenecks. Moreover, as the quality of the data and the structure are broader, more adaptable and variedw, it is difficult to coordinate and identify the information using the inverted index for text data of the conventional crawling method. Consequently, the implementation of web crawling based on distributed systems provides a powerful solution to the problems with the growth of distributed computing and Big Data technologies. This project is centered around building a Distributed Web Crawler that gathers the information needed from web pages and makes it easily accessible and manageable for the user. The collected data is stored in a database and is accessible through a command line interface.

              As the name suggests, Octocat Classifier is used to determine whether a given image contains an Octocat. It is trained with images from the [Octodex](1), images shared with [#MyOctocat on Twitter](2), and [photographs of laptops with :octocat: stickers on them]().
