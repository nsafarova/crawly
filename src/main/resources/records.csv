Financial Services FICO Uses AWS to Innovate Faster, Reduce Costs, and Expand Global Reach Learn how FICO used AWS to develop products and deploy them to market faster. Learn More Betting Big on the Cloud For years, FICO lacked the agility to quickly develop and deploy its solutions to the market. New products sometimes took years to create and deliver. Seeking to focus on implementing software more efficiently, FICO turned to AWS. Breaking the Financial High Score FICO chose AWS as its cloud provider in part because of its built-in security. AWS also offered the necessary experience to help FICO navigate its increasingly complex regulatory and compliance requirements. Investing in Innovation Using AWS, FICO can deliver solutions in a matter of hours instead of weeks. FICO developers now have more time to build and enhance products instead of provisioning and managing servers. Fitness Peloton Powers Connected, At-Home Fitness Community Using AWS Learn how the global interactive fitness platform is growing its business and serving its members better using AWS. Learn More Transforming Home Fitness Peloton was founded in 2012 by a team of five people, and launched on Kickstarter in 2013. The company was born on AWS and delivered its first bike in 2014. In seven years, Peloton has grown to more than 1.4 million members who collectively have ridden hundreds of million of virtual miles. Powering Communities at Scale Peloton uses AWS to power the leaderboard in its live-streamed and on-demand fitness classes, and it requires high elasticity, low latency, and real-time processing to deliver customizable rider data for the community of more than 1.4 million members riding together from their homes. Launching New Features to Serve Members Better Using AWS, Peloton can quickly test and launch new features to improve the unique experience of home-based community fitness. Real Estate Zillow Transforms Real Estate Using AWS Zillow helped bring the real estate industry online, then reinvented the home-search process using AWS Cloud. Using AWS, Zillow delivers accurate home data to buyers, sellers, and renters, allowing them to make informed decisions in fast-paced markets. Learn More Growing Demand for Speed and Scale When Zillow created its home-valuation tool—Zestimate—nearly 15 years ago, it had to develop an on-premises machine learning framework to process an array of data. But, as its popularity and complexity grew, Zillow needed a better way to deliver Zestimates on nearly 100 million homes across the country. Faster, More Dynamic Home Valuations Zillow moved its Zestimate framework to AWS, giving it the speed and scale to deliver home valuations in near-real time. The more dynamic valuations better reflect both the unique features of each home and what’s happening in the local housing market, so customers have the latest data as they explore the buying or selling process. Reaching Customers at the Market’s Pace In hot housing markets, homes can go from listing to offer in just days. Zillow built AWS technologies into its infrastructure to quickly and reliably deliver hundreds of millions of emails each month, keeping customers apprised of the latest listings, home statuses, and more.

If you believe that your intellectual property rights are being infringed, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement. RISK OF LOSS All purchases of physical items from Amazon are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier. RETURNS, REFUNDS AND TITLE Amazon does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, Amazon does not take title to the refunded item. For more information about our returns and refunds, please see our Returns Center . PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS Amazon attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Amazon does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any Amazon Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Amazon itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition. PRICING ""List Price"" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on Amazon and other retailers. Certain products may have a ""Was Price"" displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on Amazon. With respect to items sold by Amazon, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by Amazon is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item. We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you. APP PERMISSIONS When you use apps created by Amazon, such as the Amazon App or Kindle App, you may grant certain permissions to us for your device. Most mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions. To learn more about these permissions, click here .

DISPUTES Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Amazon Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Amazon or through Amazon.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 208 MC-CSC1, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Amazon will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. APPLICABLE LAW By using any Amazon Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Amazon.

Financial Services FICO Uses AWS to Innovate Faster, Reduce Costs, and Expand Global Reach Learn how FICO used AWS to develop products and deploy them to market faster. Learn More Betting Big on the Cloud For years, FICO lacked the agility to quickly develop and deploy its solutions to the market. New products sometimes took years to create and deliver. Seeking to focus on implementing software more efficiently, FICO turned to AWS. Breaking the Financial High Score FICO chose AWS as its cloud provider in part because of its built-in security. AWS also offered the necessary experience to help FICO navigate its increasingly complex regulatory and compliance requirements.

Fitness Peloton Powers Connected, At-Home Fitness Community Using AWS Learn how the global interactive fitness platform is growing its business and serving its members better using AWS. Learn More Transforming Home Fitness Peloton was founded in 2012 by a team of five people, and launched on Kickstarter in 2013. The company was born on AWS and delivered its first bike in 2014. In seven years, Peloton has grown to more than 1.4 million members who collectively have ridden hundreds of million of virtual miles. Powering Communities at Scale Peloton uses AWS to power the leaderboard in its live-streamed and on-demand fitness classes, and it requires high elasticity, low latency, and real-time processing to deliver customizable rider data for the community of more than 1.4 million members riding together from their homes.

Real Estate Zillow Transforms Real Estate Using AWS Zillow helped bring the real estate industry online, then reinvented the home-search process using AWS Cloud. Using AWS, Zillow delivers accurate home data to buyers, sellers, and renters, allowing them to make informed decisions in fast-paced markets. Learn More Growing Demand for Speed and Scale When Zillow created its home-valuation tool—Zestimate—nearly 15 years ago, it had to develop an on-premises machine learning framework to process an array of data. But, as its popularity and complexity grew, Zillow needed a better way to deliver Zestimates on nearly 100 million homes across the country. Faster, More Dynamic Home Valuations Zillow moved its Zestimate framework to AWS, giving it the speed and scale to deliver home valuations in near-real time. The more dynamic valuations better reflect both the unique features of each home and what’s happening in the local housing market, so customers have the latest data as they explore the buying or selling process. Reaching Customers at the Market’s Pace In hot housing markets, homes can go from listing to offer in just days. Zillow built AWS technologies into its infrastructure to quickly and reliably deliver hundreds of millions of emails each month, keeping customers apprised of the latest listings, home statuses, and more.

Required Cookies & Technologies Some of the technologies we use are necessary for critical functions like security and site integrity, account authentication, security and privacy preferences, internal site usage and maintenance data, and to make the site work correctly for browsing and transactions. Always on Personalized Advertising These are third party technologies used for things like interest based Etsy ads. We do this with marketing and advertising partners (who may have their own information they’ve collected). Saying no will not stop you from seeing Etsy ads or impact Etsy's own personalization technologies, but it may make the ads you see less relevant or more repetitive.

These technologies help Etsy function, allow us to understand how you use the Services, and have a number of purposes (beyond just advertising) that you can read about in this policy. The previous version of this policy can be found here. In this policy, we'll refer to Etsy.com as the ""Site"" and Etsy's mobile applications as the ""Apps."" We'll refer to the Site, the Apps, Pattern by Etsy, Etsy Payments, and our other services collectively as the ""Services."" Etsy, Inc. and Etsy Ireland UC are referred to as ""Etsy"" throughout this policy. We’ll refer to cookies and similar technologies collectively as “Cookie Technologies.” Types of Cookie Technologies Purposes Services in the Apps (SDKs) Consent, Contract, and Legitimate Interests in Processing Managing Your Cookie Technology Preferences Contact Us 1. Types of Cookie Technologies Cookies Cookies are small data files sent from a server to your web browser. They are stored in your browser’s cache and allow a website or a third party to recognize your browser. There are three primary types of cookies: Session cookies are specific to a particular visit and carry information as you view different pages so you don’t have to re-enter information every time you change pages or attempt to checkout. Session cookies expire and delete themselves automatically in a short period of time like after you leave the Site or when you close your web browser. Persistent cookies remember certain information about your preferences for viewing the site, and allow Etsy to recognize you each time you return. Persistent cookies are stored on your browser cache or mobile device until you choose to delete them, and otherwise typically delete themselves at expiration. Third-party cookies are placed by someone other than Etsy, and may gather browsing activity across multiple websites and across multiple sessions. They are usually a type of persistent cookie and are stored until you delete them or they expire based on the time period set in each third-party cookie. Cookies store data about your use, but they are helpful because they allow us to help Etsy function and customize your experience. You can configure your desktop or mobile browser's settings to reflect your preference to accept or reject cookies, including how to handle third-party cookies (see Managing Your Cookie Technology Preferences below). A description of Etsy’s principal first party cookies can be found in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. Other Technologies In addition to cookies, there are other similar technologies used by Etsy and elsewhere on the web or in mobile ecosystems. Web beacons: These are tiny graphics (sometimes called “clear GIFs” or “web pixels”) with a unique identifier that are used to understand browsing activity. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are rendered invisibly on web pages when you open a page. Social widgets: These are buttons or icons provided by third-party social media providers that allow you to interact with those social media services when you view a web page or a mobile app screen. These social widgets may collect browsing data, which may be received by the third party that provided the widget, and are controlled by the third parties. UTM codes: These are strings that can appear in a URL (the “Uniform Resource Locator,” which is typically the http or https address entered to go to a web page) when a user moves from one web page or website to another, where the string can represent information about browsing, such as which advertisement, page, or publisher sent the user to the receiving website. Application SDKs: These are mobile application third-party software development kits that are embedded in the Apps (and are used in many mobile applications). These app SDKs permit the collection of information about the app itself, activity in the app, and the device the application is running on. Local Storage Objects: These are sets of data that can be stored on your browser by a site or app. They can be used to maintain preferences, a history of usage, or even the state or settings of a site or an app. Internet of Things identifiers: Like mobile identifiers, internet-connected devices such as voice activated assistants or smart TVs may send identifiers and other data analogous to web browsers or mobile SDKs. 2. Purposes Etsy uses Cookie Technologies to recognize your logged-in state on Etsy, to understand what purchases members and visitors are interested in, to make Etsy’s Sites function for you, and to help your browsing experience and use of the Site, Services, and Apps feel more customized. More generally, Etsy uses Cookie Technologies for the following. Security and Authentication (Strictly Necessary) Some cookie and similar technology functions are necessary and vital to ensuring that Etsy works properly for visitors and members, such as maintaining the security, safety, and integrity of the Site, authentication and logging into Etsy (including remembering permissions and consents you have granted), and ensuring the ability to securely complete transactions. Account and User Preferences Some technologies are used to remember your account and preferences over time, such as keeping yourself logged in when returning to Etsy, maintaining your choices on Etsy features and how you want Etsy to appear (including keeping track of your preferred language and country), and customizing content based on how you use Etsy. Social Networks Some technologies help you to interact with social networks you are signed into while using the Services, such as sharing content with the social network, logging in with the social network, and other features you employ with the social network, or that are allowed in the social network’s privacy policy. These may be set and controlled by the social networks, and your preferences with those social networks. Social networks may also work with Etsy or with you for analytics or for marketing purposes, as discussed below. You may be able to manage your privacy preferences for these social networks and their tools and widgets via your account with the social network. You can find more information on specific social media tools and widgets in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. Performance and Analytics Some technologies help provide performance data on how the Services are functioning in order to improve Etsy and the Services, including, for example, data on site and app functionality and speed to help us optimize Etsy, how the Services are used to help us improve your experience on Etsy, and detecting and gathering reporting on bugs to help make Etsy work better. In addition, Etsy may employ transient technologies, including cookies or local stored objects, for site performance, experiments, form information, and interactions with the site, and may use temporary, short-term cookies for limited-time site events such as sales and promotions. The Site employs Google Analytics to help understand how Etsy is used by its community. For some of the advertising features listed below, like retargeting, data from Google Analytics may be combined with Etsy’s first-party data and third-party cookies (like Google’s advertising cookies) as permitted by Google’s and Etsy’s respective policies. To see how to opt-out of Google Analytics Advertising Features, see Managing your Cookie Technology Preferences at the bottom of this policy. The Site also employs Facebook App Events SDKs for analytics in the Apps in a similar fashion, subject to your Opt-Out. You can find more information on how Google Analytics works in this Google guide and on Facebook App Events here. Marketing Services Etsy partners with third-party service providers that may use various Cookie Technologies to permit us and them to learn about which ads you see and click when you visit Etsy, the Apps, and affiliated sites or to show you ads on and off Etsy. These may include things such as: Frequency capping, which limits the number of times a user’s browser or mobile device displays the same ad; Attribution tracking, which estimates which advertising or marketing source brought someone to Etsy, or determines which marketing source led to actions like a visit or a purchase; Remarketing and retargeting, which shows relevant ads to an audience based on prior shopping and browsing patterns on Etsy; Audience targeting, which refers to targeting advertisements to a large audience based on the audience’s known or inferred demographics; and Cross-device recognition, which recognizes actions across multiple devices or browsers. Some third-party service providers may provide information like demographics, cross-device information, or interest categories from a combination of sources that, while not identifying you personally, permit us to provide you with more relevant and useful advertising. In some cases, this information may have non-marketing performance analytics uses as well. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer, mobile device or network device (like an IoT device such as a voice-activated assistant or smart TV), each time you visit Etsy or other websites and mobile applications based on data like a cookie, your IP address, or device ID, but do not allow access to other personal information from Etsy. However, these technologies may allow us or a third party to recognize you, either from a single device or across devices, over time. These third parties are required to follow applicable laws, self-regulatory programs, and Etsy’s data protection rules where applicable. Etsy does not have control over these third parties, who each have their own privacy policies and privacy practices. Etsy adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. For audience targeting, Etsy may share hashed identifiers that represent an email address or name with partners Google and/or Facebook so they can provide Etsy with audiences interested in specific types of products and services. Google and/or Facebook will only provide this information, and can only identify you, based on their separate policies and agreements with their users. More information is provided in Etsy’s Cookies and Similar Technologies Disclosures. You can find a description of third-party Cookie Technologies used by Etsy, along with their respective privacy policies and options for controlling your privacy on these platforms, in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. 3. Services in the Apps (SDKs) The Apps may include third-party application software development kits (“SDKs”) that provide mobile performance and analytics data, bug reporting features, and application program interfaces (""APIs"") to third parties that help provide the Services, for social media functionality, and for marketing and advertising. You can find a description of principal third-party SDKs used by Etsy, along with their respective privacy policies and options for controlling your privacy on these platforms, in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. 4. Consent, Contract, and Legitimate Interests in Processing Certain Cookie Technologies are employed to make the Site function for its intended purpose, and are provided based on contractual necessity based on your agreement with Etsy to perform the services you have requested. These include the functions strictly necessary to the service noted above. By choosing to use our Services after having been notified of our use of Cookie Technologies in the ways described in this Policy, and, in applicable jurisdictions, through notice and unambiguous acknowledgement of your consent, you agree to such use. More information is laid out in our Privacy Policy. 5. Managing Your Cookie Technology Preferences You have the ability to control the use of certain Cookie Technologies. You can opt out of third party marketing cookies and similar technologies via the Privacy Settings link available at the bottom of most Etsy site pages, or via the GDPR Preferences link for users in the European Union and EEA. You can also manage your Etsy marketing preferences in your account settings. As noted previously, information on third party privacy policies and opt-out process can be found in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. Opt-in and Opt-out for Browsers In addition, when you use Etsy via a browser, you can change your web browser's settings to reflect your cookie preferences. Each browser is a little different, but usually these settings are under the ""options"" or ""preferences"" menu. The links below provide information about cookie settings for the browsers supported by Etsy: Microsoft Edge Internet Explorer Firefox Chrome Safari Opt-out of Third-Party Networks If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based advertisements, in addition you may decline to receive interest based ads through TrustE/TrustArc’s preferences manager (or if you are located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not stop you from being served advertisements. You will continue to receive generic advertisements. If you reject or block all cookies in your browser settings, you will not be able to take advantage of Etsy's Services as some cookies are necessary for the Site to function properly. You can learn more about managing your preferences for ads online, particularly for many third-party advertising networks, through resources made available by the Digital Advertising Alliance at https://www.aboutads.info or the Network Advertising Initiative at https://optout.networkadvertising.org. Google Analytics Opt-out For Google Analytics Advertising Features, you can opt-out through Google Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the NAI's consumer opt-out listed above). Google also provides a Google Analytics opt-out plug-in for the web. Third-Party Tools Various third parties provide browser plug-ins and apps that can help provide you information on and limit or block third-party cookies, web beacons, and some Javascript-based technologies. Etsy cannot vouch for the efficacy of a particular third-party product, but popular products that provide these privacy enhancements include Ghostery and AdBlock Plus. Both Google and Facebook provide tools to control use of advertising on their respective platforms, including advertising on and with Etsy. More information can be found in your account settings on the respective platforms, including in Google’s Privacy Center and in Facebook’s Ad Settings. Mobile and Third Party Device Opt-out If you access Etsy through the Apps, you may also control interest-based advertising on an iOS or Android device by selecting the “Limit Ad Tracking” option in the privacy section of the Settings App on iOS or via advertising preferences on Android-based devices (usually in the Google Settings app). This will not prevent you from seeing advertisements but will limit the use of device advertising identifiers to personalize ads based on your interests. For third party IoT devices such as voice activated assistants or smart TVs, consult with the manufacturer and/or service provider for the opt out mechanism for their respective devices and services. 6.

We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies or practices of any of our members, websites hosted through Pattern by Etsy, or third-party websites and apps. Etsy’s Terms of Use require all account owners to be at least 18 years of age. Minors under 18 years of age and at least 13 years of age are permitted to use Etsy's Services only if they have permission and direct supervision by the owner of the account. Children under age 13 are not permitted to use the Services. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account.

Information Collected or Received In the course of providing our Services, we collect or receive your personal information in a few different ways. We obtain the categories of personal information listed below from the following sources: directly from you, for example, from forms you complete or during registration; indirectly from you based on your activity and interaction with our Services, or from the device or browser you use to access the Services; from our vendors and suppliers that help provide Etsy services you may interact with (such as, for example, for payments or customer support), and from our third party advertising and marketing partners. Often, you choose what information to provide, but sometimes we require certain information to provide you the Services. Etsy uses the personal information it receives and collects in accordance with the purposes described in this policy. You can also choose to provide information to a third party via Etsy’s API. While users of Etsy’s API are required to follow Etsy’s API Terms of Use, including having appropriate privacy and security controls, Etsy does not have a direct partner relationship with these third parties and their processing of information is subject to their own privacy policies. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. Registration, Account Setup, Service Usage: In order to use the Services, will need to submit a valid email address. If you register, you will need to submit a name associated with your account. You may modify that name through your account settings. You need to provide this information to enable us to provide you with the Services. Additional information, such as a shop name, billing and payment information (including billing contact name, address, telephone number, credit card information), a telephone number, and/or a physical postal address, may be necessary in order for us to provide a particular service. For example, we need a physical postal address if you are buying something on the Site for delivery. As an Etsy seller, if you choose to use our payment service (""Etsy Payments""), Etsy requires your full name, social security number, identification ID or tax ID, date of birth, bank account information, photograph, credit card information, and/or other proof of identification in order to verify your identity, provide this service to you, and comply with applicable law. For example, in certain markets, Etsy Sellers’ imprint (including trade name or individual name as applicable), may be displayed to buyers on Etsy in order to comply with local legal requirements. For both buyers and sellers, Etsy requires this information from you in order to provide you with the Services (including, to verify ownership of an account, to mitigate fraud and abuse, to comply with regulatory obligations, or to complete a transaction as a buyer or seller). We may store credit card information and other information provided to us during checkout, for billing and payment purposes, and to process your transaction. Members in certain countries can elect to save their credit card information to facilitate checkout for future purchases. If you're an Etsy buyer in the EU, Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein, you may be asked to authenticate your payment method when you place your order. To authenticate a payment, you will need to respond to a prompt from your card issuer and provide additional information, such as a correct response to a question, a password, or a passcode. Etsy may contact individual shop owners confidentially to request more information about their shops or items listed through the Services, or may request information from buyers to ensure compliance with our policies and applicable law. In order to use certain products or services on Etsy, you may be required to complete an application; information that you submit through the application process will not be displayed publicly and will only be used internally by Etsy and its service providers, unless otherwise specified. Profile: You may provide your name and other personal information (such as birthday, gender, location) in connection with your account and activity. You can edit or remove this information through your account settings. The name associated with your account (which you may modify in your account settings) is publicly displayed and connected to your Etsy activity. Other members may see the date you joined; ratings, reviews and information relating to items you review, and related photos for items you purchased or sold; your profile information; items you listed for sale; your shop pages and policies; your Favorites, followers, and those you follow; sold item listings and the number of items sold; comments you post in our community spaces; and information you decide to share via social networks. For Sellers, we may collect and use information about you in order to feature you in marketing and advocacy materials, and to feature you and your shop on and off the platform, as provided for in Etsy’s Terms of Use. From time to time, we may also ask you about certain demographic information, such as your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity, in relation to specific marketing and advocacy projects and campaigns. Providing this demographic information is entirely voluntary and at the time we ask we will also seek your consent to use it. Automated Information: Etsy automatically receives and records information from your browser or your mobile device when you visit the Site, use the Apps, or use certain features of the Services, such as your IP address or unique device identifier, cookies, and data about which pages you visit and how you interact with those pages in order to allow us to operate and provide the Services. This information is stored in log files and is collected automatically. Etsy may also receive similar information (like, for example, IP addresses and actions taken on the device) provided by a connected Internet of Things device such as a voice-activated assistant or Smart TV. We may combine this information from your browser or your mobile device with other information that we or our advertising or marketing partners collect about you, including across devices. This information is used to prevent fraud and to keep the Services secure, to analyze and understand how the Services work for members and visitors, and to provide advertising, including across your devices, and a more personalized experience for members and visitors. We also automatically collect device-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This information can include information such as the hardware model, operating system information, app version, app usage and debugging information, browser information, IP address, and device identifiers. For more information about these online tools and how we use them, see our Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy and “Information Uses, Sharing, & Disclosure” Section below. Data from Etsy Vendors and Suppliers: We also receive information from our vendors and suppliers about you. This information can include customer service interactions, payments information, shipping information, and information shared in Etsy’s forums. Data from Advertising and Marketing Partners: As described below, Etsy receives information from our advertising and marketing partners about you. This information can include attribution information via cookies and UTM tags in URLs to determine where a visit to Etsy comes from, responses to marketing emails and advertisements, responses to offers, and audience information from partners who you have given consent to share that information with us. Location Information: We collect information about your use of the Services for advertising, for analytics, to serve content, and to protect the Services. This can include your IP address, browser information (including referrers), device information (such as iOS IDFA, IDFV for limited non-advertising purposes, Android AAID, and, when enabled by you, location information provided by your device). When you use the Apps, you can choose to share your geolocation details with Etsy in order to use functions like our local marketplace, maps, and for in-person sales (although you don't need to share these details). You can choose to publish your location when you sell on Etsy. We obtain location information you provide in your profile or your IP address. With your consent, we may also determine location by using other information from your device, such as precise location information from GPS or information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device. We use and store information about your location to provide features and to improve and customize the Services, for example, for Etsy’s internal analytics and performance monitoring; localization, regional requirements, and policies for the Services; for local content, search results, and recommendations; for shipping and mapping services; and (using non-precise location information) marketing. If you have consented to share your precise device location details but would no longer like to continue sharing that information with us, you may revoke your consent to the sharing of that information through the settings on the Apps or on your mobile device. Certain non-precise location services, such as for security and localized policies based on your IP address or submitted address, are critical for the Site to function. We will only share your geolocation details with third parties (like our mapping, payments, or, to the extent applicable, advertising providers) in order to provide you with the Services. You may also choose to enable the Apps to access your mobile device’s camera to upload photographs to Etsy. Analytics Information: We use data analytics software to ensure Site and App functionality and to improve the Services. This software records information such as how often you use the Apps, what happens within the Apps, aggregated usage, performance data, app errors and debugging information, and where the Apps were downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information that you submit within the mobile application. For more information, see Etsy's Cookies and Similar Technologies Policy and Disclosures. Information from Third Parties: Some members or visitors may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook, or an app developed using Etsy's API. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, it is subject to your agreements with that third party (like their Terms of Use and privacy notices), and Etsy can receive information from that application. We may also collect public information in order to connect with you, such as when we communicate with you over social media. We may use that information as part of providing the Services to you. You can also choose to share some of your activity on Etsy on certain social media networks which are connected to your Etsy account, and you can revoke your permission anytime in your account settings. Certain third-party applications that you use to create or sign in to your account may provide you with the option to discontinue receiving messages from us or allows you to forward those messages to another email address. If we are unable to send you critical messages about your account, we may suspend or terminate your account. Non-Member Information: Etsy receives or obtains information (for example, an email address or IP address) about a person who is not yet a registered Etsy member (a “non-member”) in connection with certain Etsy features, such as when a non-member chooses to subscribe to an Etsy newsletter, a member invites a non-member to visit the Site, a member uploads non-member information using the contact uploader feature, a non-member engages in a transaction, a member sends a gift card code to a non-member, or a non-member uses Guest Checkout to make a purchase. Non-member information is used only for the purposes disclosed when it was submitted to Etsy, for purposes necessary to the functioning of Etsy's Services or where Etsy has a legitimate interest, as disclosed in the “Information Uses, Sharing, & Disclosure” Section below, or to facilitate action authorized by a member or the non-member. Pattern by Etsy: We also collect certain information from both members and non-members who visit websites hosted by us. This information may include your IP address or unique device identifier, and cookies and data from the pages you visit. To learn more about websites hosted by us through Pattern by Etsy, see our Pattern Policy. For more information on our use of cookies and collection of tracking information, see our Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy or “Information Uses, Sharing, & Disclosure” section below. 3. Findability You can choose to import your contacts from your mobile device or personal email address book, or a social network account to Etsy. We do not retain the login information for your email service, mobile device, or social network site. You can search for people you know by email address or phone number on the Site or through the contact information you import. Finding your friends on Etsy helps you connect with them on our platform. For example, you can follow another member’s public activity, such as public Favorites. When you begin following another member’s activity, they will receive an email notification (if the member has consented to receiving this type of email). If you do not want your contacts to be able to find you on Etsy through your email address, phone number, or social networking connections, then you can change your findability through your account settings. If you do not wish to be located on Etsy via your name, you can remove your name and instead may use a nickname or alias as your name in your public account information. 4. Messages from Etsy On occasion, Etsy will need to contact you. Primarily, these messages are delivered by email, Etsy Messages, or by push notifications for a variety of reasons, including marketing, transactions, advocacy, and service update purposes. If you no longer wish to receive push notifications, you can disable them at device level. You can opt out of receiving marketing communications via email or Messages in your account settings or by following the unsubscribe link in any marketing email you receive. To ensure you properly receive notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device, such as operating system and user identification information. Every account is required to keep a valid email address on file to receive messages. Etsy may also contact you by telephone to provide member support or for transaction-related purposes if you request that we call you. Additionally, and with your consent where required by applicable law, Etsy may send you an SMS (or similar) message, or reach out to you by telephone, in order to provide you with customer support, for research or feedback, or to provide you with information about products and features that you may find of interest. You can update your contact preferences in your account settings. Some messages from Etsy are service-related and necessary for members and Guest Checkout users. You understand and agree that Etsy can send you non-marketing emails, Etsy Messages, or messages, such as those related to transactions, your account, security, or product changes. Examples of service-related messages include an email address confirmation/welcome email when you register your account, notification of an order, service availability, modification of key features or functions, relaying Messages with buyers, and correspondence with Etsy’s Support team (including by chat interface or the other methods of communication as described above). When you register for an account, subscribe to a newsletter, or provide us with your email address or phone number such as for a Guest Checkout purchase, you receive notice of and agree (in some jurisdictions and situations, by an additional unambiguous consent) to receive marketing emails and messages from us. You can unsubscribe at any time from marketing emails or messages through the opt-out link included in marketing emails or messages. Members can also control which marketing emails or messages they receive from Etsy through their account settings. Please note that some changes to your account settings may take a few days to take effect. A contact-importer feature is available to help you locate and connect with your friends and contacts who may be members of Etsy (see the ""Findability"" section above for more information). If someone in your contact list is not already a member, you may invite them to join Etsy, and an email will be sent to them on your behalf. Recipients of email invitations may opt out of receiving future invitations by following instructions in the email invitation message. You may send an invitation only to someone who has given you consent to receive one. 5. Community Etsy is a marketplace and a community. We offer several features that allow members to connect and communicate in public or semi-public spaces, such as Forums and Teams, which are a part of the Etsy Community space. You don't have to use these features, but if you do, please use common sense and good judgment when posting in these community spaces or sharing your personal information with others through the Services. Be aware that any personal information that you choose to submit there can be read, collected, or used by others, or could be used to send unsolicited messages to you. We engage certain third parties to assist in providing community services to you and, in the context of that relationship, we need to share some of your information with such third parties in order to provide that service. This may include, for example, information from your Etsy account that is publicly available, your account’s status, your forum posts and Team memberships, your Etsy username and/or shop name, the display name you’ve optionally chosen to share publicly in your Etsy account, avatar image, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. If you close your Etsy account, your Community account, which allows you to post in Forums, will also be closed and related personal information will be deleted. However, your posts may remain public after your account is closed, although your name will no longer be displayed alongside the post. You are responsible for the personal information that you choose to post in community spaces through the Services. You can set your privacy preferences and download your data in your Community Settings, and close or delete your Community account by submitting a request to Etsy. Another member may follow your public activity on the Site to receive updates, such as when you add an item to your public Favorites. You may choose to make certain activities private through your account settings. You have the option to block any member with whom you do not wish to share your updates. 6. Information Uses, Sharing, & Disclosure We respect your privacy. Etsy will not disclose your name, email address, or other personal information to third parties without your consent, except as specified in this policy. You can control your privacy settings through the opt-out buttons in your account settings privacy tab, and the Privacy Settings link in the footer of most site pages and our homepage. Please note that some changes to your privacy settings may take a few days to take effect. We or our sellers may advertise our Services or our sellers’ products through a variety of different mediums and rely on your consent to do so off-site. Legal Bases When you access or use the Services, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. We rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. These legal bases include where: Necessary to perform the contractual obligations in our Terms of Use and in order to provide the Services to you; You have consented to the processing, which you can revoke at any time; Necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend any impending or asserted legal claims; Necessary for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate interests, such as those of visitors, members, or partners (described in more detail below); You have expressly made the information public; Necessary in the public interest, such as to prevent crime; and Occasionally necessary to protect your vital interests or those of others (in rare cases where we may need to share information to prevent loss of life or personal injury). We principally rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at anytime) (i) to send marketing messages, (ii) for third-party data sharing related to advertising, and, to the extent applicable, (iii) for the use of location data for advertising purposes. We rely on consent for targeted online and offline marketing including through tools like Facebook Custom Audience and Google Customer Match. We or our sellers may advertise our Services or our sellers’ products through a variety of different mediums and rely on your consent to do so off-site. As part of this, we may work with advertising partners such as Facebook, Google, and other partners disclosed in our Cookies and Similar Technology Policy. These partners have their own privacy policies and consent mechanisms for their customers, in addition to Etsy’s controls. You may see the privacy policies and privacy choices for these partners, and the information you share with them, in our Cookies and Similar Technology Disclosures. Etsy may also use first party data (e.g. your prior shopping and browsing patterns on our Site), and may combine it with other data collected from you, such as your location, or publicly available information, to permit us to create targeted audiences based on your known or inferred demographic and/or interests to provide you with more relevant and useful advertising on our site, in our direct marketing channels (like email), or with our off site marketing partners, like Google and Facebook, subject to their terms and privacy notice you agreed to with such partners . Our Legitimate Interests Where we process your information on the basis of legitimate interests, we do so as follows: Providing and Improving our Services: We use your information to improve and customize our Services, including sharing your information for such purposes, and we do so as it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests of improving our Services for our users. This is also necessary to enable us to pursue our legitimate interests in understanding how our Services are being used, and to explore and unlock ways to develop and grow our business. It is also necessary to allow us to pursue our legitimate interests in improving our Services, efficiency, interest in Services for users, and obtaining insights into usage patterns of our Services. As a core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in customizing your on-site experience to help you search for and discover relevant items and recommended purchases, including using this information to help sellers find the best ways to market and sell their products on Etsy. Providing Marketing Communications: We rely on our legitimate interest to send you marketing messages (where permitted independent of consent) and for Etsy's advertising programs (including Etsy’s on-site advertising and marketing). Keeping our Services Safe and Secure: We use your information for safety and security purposes, which can include sharing your information for such purposes, and we do so because it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests or those of a third party in ensuring the security of our Services, preventing harm to individuals or property, or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, or preventing damage to Etsy’s systems, or those of our users or our partners. This includes enhancing protection of our community against spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime, and security risks of all kinds. We use your information to provide and improve the Services, for billing and payments, for identification and authentication, and for general research and aggregate reporting. For example, in accordance with our existing case resolution process, we may use information you provide to resolve disputes with Etsy or other members. Buying and Selling: As part of the buying and selling process, Etsy will facilitate the sharing of information between the two members involved in the transaction, such as the other Etsy member's shipping address and payment status. This can also involve us sharing your information with some of our third party partners such as our shipping and payment partners to enable us to provide the Service to you. Such partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. In some instances, while they are subject to Etsy’s privacy and security requirements for vendors, these partners, not Etsy, are responsible for the protection of personal information under their control. By making a sale or a purchase on Etsy, you are directing us to share your information in this way. Since this is an important part of the Services we provide, we need to do this in order to perform our obligations under our Terms of Use. We expect you to respect the privacy of the member whose information you have received. As described in Etsy's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use that information only for Etsy-related communications or for Etsy-facilitated transactions. Etsy has not granted a license to you to use the information for unauthorized transactions or sending unsolicited commercial messages in violation of any applicable laws, including any consent requirements of the jurisdiction of the recipient. You should only add a member to your email or physical mailing list or otherwise use or store a member’s personal information in accordance with applicable laws, including any consent requirements that apply in that member's jurisdiction. Site Customization: We may learn about the types of products that you’re interested in from your browsing and purchasing behavior on (and off) the Site or Apps and use such information to suggest potential purchases as a result. As a core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in customizing your on-site experience to help you search for and discover relevant items and recommended purchases, including using this information to help sellers find the best ways to market and sell their products on Etsy. Legal and Safety: Etsy may also retain, preserve, or release your personal information to a third party in the following limited circumstances: in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet legitimate national security or law enforcement requirements; to protect, establish, or exercise our legal rights or defend against impending or asserted legal claims, including to collect a debt, or a material violation of our policies (including our Intellectual Property Policy); to comply with a subpoena, court order, legal process, regulation, or other legal requirement; or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to our rights or property, or violations of Etsy's Terms of Use. For example, if permitted due to the forgoing circumstances, your information may be shared with tax authorities or other governmental agencies. In the cases set out above, our use of your information may be necessary for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate interest in keeping our Services secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, or preventing damage. Such use may also be necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend legal claims or to facilitate the collection of taxes and prevention of tax fraud. It may also be necessary in the public interest (such as to prevent crime) or to protect vital interests (in rare cases where we may need to share information to prevent loss of life or personal injury). If Etsy receives a lawful, verified request for a member’s records or information in one of the limited circumstances described in the previous paragraph, Etsy may disclose personal information, which may include, but may not be limited to, a member’s name, address, phone number, email address, company/trading name and, where appropriate, bank account and transaction details. Find out more about how Etsy responds to requests for records or information about members of Etsy’s community in our Requests for Information Policy. Affiliated Businesses: Etsy is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them for a variety of purposes, including assisting us to perform and improve the Services. These businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or, with your consent, offer promotions (including email promotions) to you. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, including providing you with the opportunity to sign up with such partners and allow them to more effectively market to you. When an affiliated business assists in facilitating your transaction, we may need to share information related to the transaction with that affiliated business in order to facilitate your transaction, and this forms part of the Services we provide in accordance with our Terms of Use. We rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at any time) to send marketing messages and for third-party sharing relating to advertising. As part of this, we may work with advertising partners such as Facebook or Google, and we may use analytics aggregated from usage information including, for example, search keywords, favorites, browsing history, and purchase history. Aggregated Information: Etsy may share demographic information with business partners, but it will be aggregated and de-personalized so that personal information is not revealed. Service Providers: Etsy also needs to engage third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, and analytics and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and market the Services. These third parties have only limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are obligated to Etsy not to disclose or use your information for other purposes. Our engagement of service providers is often necessary for us to provide the Services to you, particularly where such companies play important roles like helping us keep our Service operating and secure. In some other cases, these service providers aren’t strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into how we could better serve our users. In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service providers to make our Services better. Business Reorganization: In some cases, Etsy may choose to buy or sell assets. Such transactions may be necessary and in our legitimate interests, particularly our interest in making decisions that enable our business to develop over the long term. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site and the App, and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt out before information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Third Parties: Third-party plug-ins also collect information about your use of the Site. For example, when you load a page on Etsy that has a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a “Like” or “Send” button, you are also loading content from that third-party site. That site may request cookies directly from your browser. These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party site. In addition, certain cookies and other similar technologies on the Site are used by third parties for targeted online marketing and other purposes. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you use the Services. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services. Etsy chooses and manages these third-party technologies placed on its Sites and Apps. However, these are third-party technologies, and they are subject to that third party's privacy policy. For more information, see our Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy. We rely on your consent to drop and read these cookies when not technically necessary or when not required based on another purpose such as legitimate interest. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (such as other members who sell using the Services, certain third-party providers on whom we rely to provide certain services, or API users) that Etsy does not own or control or individuals that Etsy does not employ or manage, except as otherwise provided for in the Terms or as required by law. If you provide your information to such third parties in connection with your use of the Services, different practices may apply to the use or disclosure of the information that you provide to them. While Etsy requires these third parties to follow Etsy’s privacy and security requirements, Etsy does not control the privacy or security policies of such third parties. To the full extent applicable in your jurisdiction, Etsy is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of these sellers, API users, or other websites on the internet, even those linked to or from the Services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. For the purposes of European law, these sellers, third party providers, and API users are independent controllers of data, which means that they are responsible for providing and complying with their own policies relating to any personal information they obtain in connection with the Services. 7. Transfers Etsy operates a global service. If you reside outside of North or South America, your personal information is controlled by Etsy Ireland UC. By using our Services, you understand that Etsy Ireland UC may share some of the information it gathers with Etsy, Inc. (its US parent company) or other Etsy affiliates for purposes described in this privacy policy, including for ID verification, transaction reviews, and payment processing. The United States, European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country. In particular, if your information is in the US, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with US law. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information: Model Clauses The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of Europe. We often use these Model Clauses when transferring personal information outside of Europe. You can request a copy of our Model Clauses by emailing legal@etsy.com. Necessary for the Performance of the Contract between Etsy and its Members Etsy provides a voluntary service; you can choose whether or not to use the Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the U.S. to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our Terms of Use), we need to transfer your personal information to the U.S. and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information around the world. 8. Security The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after it is received, for example encryption is used for certain information (such as credit card numbers) using TLS (transport layer security). Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Your account information is protected by a password. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your account and information by choosing your password carefully and by keeping your password and computer secure, such as by signing out after using the Services. Etsy offers advanced security features and settings for members, such as two-factor authentication for signing in, and sign in history and notifications; you can view more information in your account settings. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at legal@etsy.com. 9. Retention Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as your account is active (i.e., for the lifetime of your Etsy member account), or as needed to provide the Services to you. If you no longer want Etsy to use your information to provide the Services to you, you may close your account. Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this policy. In addition, Etsy sellers may also be required to retain and use your information in order to comply with their own legal obligations. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. We also retain log files for internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for a brief period of time, except in cases where they are used for site safety and security, to improve site functionality, or we are legally obligated to retain them for longer time periods. 10. Your Rights & Choices Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), provide users with rights related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. You may change or correct your Etsy account information through your account settings. You may also remove certain optional information that you no longer wish to be publicly visible through the Services, such as your name. You can also request to permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Depending on your location, you may also benefit from a number of rights with respect to your information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply in limited cases. Right to Access & Portability: You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format and information explaining how that information is used. See this Help Center article for more information. Right to Correction: You have the right to request that we rectify inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account. Right to Restrict Processing: In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information. Right to Deletion: In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, and integrity of Etsy. See this Help Center article for more information. Right to Object: If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. Where we use your personal data for direct marketing purposes, you can object using the unsubscribe link in such communications or changing your account email settings. Right to Withdraw Consent: Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using specific features provided to enable you to withdraw consent, like an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details but would no longer like to continue sharing that information with us, you can revoke your consent to the sharing of that information through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. The CCPA provides California residents with the following additional rights: Right to Know: California residents may request disclosure of the specific pieces and/or categories of personal information that the business has collected about them, the categories of sources for that personal information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting the information, the categories of personal information that we have disclosed, and the categories of third parties with which the information was shared. Right to Opt-Out: To the extent that Etsy “sells” personal information(as that term is defined under the CCPA), California residents are entitled to opt-out of the “sale” of data at any time (see below for more information). If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Etsy account settings. Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above by contacting us by submitting a message through our contact form available in our Help Center, chat support, or through any other channels available via our Help Center. Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will confirm receipt of your request. Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information. However, we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights, including otherwise denying you goods or services, providing you with a different level or quality of services, or charging you different prices or rates for services. If you need further assistance, you can contact Etsy through one of the channels listed below under “Contact”. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. Please note that we may verify your identity before we are able to process any of the requests described in this Section, and in our discretion, deny your request if we are unable to verify your identity. As a part of this process, government or other identification may be required. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification, and we may verify the authenticity of the request directly with you. Email & Messages You may also control the receipt of certain types of communications from Etsy in your account settings. Etsy may send you messages about the Services or your activity. Some of these messages are required, service-related messages for members (such as transactional messages or legal notices). Other messages are not required, such as newsletters. You can control which optional messages you choose to receive by changing your account settings, and you can learn more in the “Messages from Etsy” Section of this policy. If you no longer wish to use the Services or receive service-related messages (except for legally required notices), then you may close your account. Click here to learn how to close your account. Cookies We use both technically necessary (for the functioning and security of the Services) and non-technically necessary cookies and similar technologies. A more detailed explanation of the technologies we use, and how to opt out when applicable, can be found in Etsy’s Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy. Additional Disclosures for California Residents Notice of Collection In addition to the Rights & Choices described above, the CCPA requires disclosure of the categories of personal information collected over the past 12 months. While this information is provided in greater detail in the “Information Collected or Received Section above, the categories of personal information that we have collected – as described by the CCPA – are: Identifiers, including name, email address, shop name, IP address, and an ID or number assigned to your account. Other individual records such as phone number, billing address, or credit or debit card information. This category includes personal information protected under pre-existing California law (Cal. Civ. Code 1798.80(e)), and overlaps with other categories listed here. Demographics, such as your age or gender, or, where you have provided such information to Etsy voluntarily, demographic information about your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity, provided in relation to specific marketing and advocacy projects and campaigns.This category includes data that may qualify as protected classifications under other California or federal laws. Commercial information, including purchases and engagement with the Services. Internet activity, including your interactions with our Services and what led you to our Services. Sensory visual data, such as pictures posted on our Service. Geolocation data provided through location enabled services such as WiFi and GPS. Inferences, including information about your interests, preferences and favorites. The Purposes for Our Collection We collect and use these categories of personal information for our business and commercial purposes described in the “Information Uses, Sharing and Disclosure” Section above, including providing and improving the Services, maintaining the safety and security of the Services, processing purchase and sale transactions, and for advertising and marketing services. Third Party Marketing and Advertising and Your Rights (Opt-Out of “Sale”) Etsy does not sell personal information to third parties for monetary value. However, the term “sale” is defined broadly under the California Consumer Privacy Act. To the extent that “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include interest based advertising or other data uses described in the “Information Uses, Sharing and Disclosure” Section above, we will comply with applicable law as to those activities. You can read more in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy. To opt-out of receiving interest based advertising, you can exercise your choice by using your account privacy settings, or the general privacy settings link located at the footer of our homepage and most pages of the Site. The right to opt-out of interest based advertising is available to all Etsy users. Do Not Track Signals Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com. Shine the Light California law entitles residents to ask for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. Other than to Sellers on Etsy (see “Buying and Selling” under the “Information Uses, Sharing and Disclosure” Section above), who must obtain your separate consent for their own marketing off of Etsy, or unless you request us to or consent to it, Etsy does not share any personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If you have questions about these practices, you can contact us through one of the channels listed in the “Contact” Section below. For information on interest based advertising with Etsy and how your information is used for marketing, see Etsy’s Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy. Accessibility If you have a disability and would like to access this policy in an alternative format, please contact us using one of the channels listed in the “Contact” section below. 11. Your Responsibilities If you sell using our Services or use Etsy’s API, you may receive and determine what to do with certain personal information. Your privacy responsibilities, including when you act as an independent data controller (someone who decides what personal data to collect and the purpose you use the data for) are laid out in the Etsy Seller Policy and the Etsy API Terms of Use. 12. Privacy Policy Changes We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by doing one (or more) of the following: (i) posting the changes on or through the Services, (ii) sending you an email or message about the changes, or (iii) posting an update in the version notes on the Apps’ platform. We encourage you to check back regularly and review any updates. 13.

Create a Free Account Contact Sales Find Out How Much You Could Be Saving in the AWS Cloud AWS Pricing Calculator AWS offers you a pay-as-you-go approach for pricing for over 160 cloud services. With AWS you pay only for the individual services you need, for as long as you use them, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. AWS pricing is similar to how you pay for utilities like water and electricity. You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees. How do you pay for AWS? Pay-as-you-go With AWS you only pay for what use, helping your organization remain agile, responsive and always able to meet scale demands. Pay-as-you-go pricing allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes. With a pay as you go model, you can adapt your business depending on need and not on forecasts, reducing the risk or overprovisioning or missing capacity. By paying for services on an as needed basis, you can redirect your focus to innovation and invention, reducing procurement complexity and enabling your business to be fully elastic. On Premises/Colocation YEARS UNDERUTILIZATION AWS Close Save when you reserve For certain services like Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS, you can invest in reserved capacity. With Reserved Instances, you can save up to 75% over equivalent on-demand capacity. Reserved Instances are available in 3 options – All up-front (AURI), partial up-front (PURI) or no upfront payments (NURI). When you buy Reserved Instances, the larger the upfront payment, the greater the discount. To maximize your savings, you can pay all up-front and receive the largest discount. Partial up-front RI's offer lower discounts but give you the option to spend less up front. Lastly, you can choose to spend nothing up front and receive a smaller discount, but allowing you to free up capital to spend in other projects. By using reserved capacity, your organization can minimize risks, more predictably manage budgets, and comply with policies that require longer-term commitments.

For services such as S3 and data transfer OUT from EC2, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB. In addition, data transfer IN is always free of charge. As a result, as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economies of scale that allow you to increase adoption and keep costs under control. As your organization evolves, AWS also gives you options to acquire services that help you address your business needs. For example, AWS’ storage services portfolio, offers options to help you lower pricing based on how frequently you access data, and the performance you need to retrieve it. To optimize your savings, choose the right combinations of storage solutions that help you reduce costs while preserving performance, security and durability.

Automatic Information: We automatically collect and store certain types of information about your use of Amazon Services, including information about your interaction with content and services available through Amazon Services. Like many websites, we use ""cookies"" and other unique identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser or device accesses Amazon Services and other content served by or on behalf of Amazon on other websites. Click here to see examples of what we collect. Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources, such as updated delivery and address information from our carriers, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase more easily. Click here to see additional examples of the information we receive. For What Purposes Does Amazon Use Your Personal Information? We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. These purposes include: Purchase and delivery of products and services. We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services, and promotional offers. Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Amazon Services. We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyze performance, fix errors, and improve the usability and effectiveness of the Amazon Services. Recommendations and personalization. We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with Amazon Services.

We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat). Advertising.

We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, Amazon, and others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks. What About Cookies and Other Identifiers? To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve Amazon Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our Cookies Notice. Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information? Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share customers' personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries Amazon.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. Transactions involving Third Parties: We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions with that third party. Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. Protection of Amazon and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. How Secure Is Information About Me? We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software. We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose personal information to you. Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click here for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Amazon account that is not used for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Click here for more information on how to sign off. What About Advertising? Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads notice. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising Preferences page. Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising Preferences page. What Information Can I Access? You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the ""Your Account"" section of the website. Click here for a list of examples that you can access. What Choices Do I Have? If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, please contact our Customer Service. Many of our Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with options as to how your information is being used. As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services. You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in What Information Can I Access?. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. If you do not want to receive email or other communications from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. If you don't want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or device. If you do not want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your Advertising Preferences. The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Amazon Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies and other identifiers, see our Cookies Notice. If you want to browse our websites without linking the browsing history to your account, you may do so by logging out of your account here and blocking cookies on your browser. You can manage the recommendations you receive in our store here, remove recommendations you don’t want to see here by selecting View All and Manage then selecting the Remove Items toggle that appears at the top of the page, and edit your browsing history here. You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on the applicable Amazon website (e.g., in ""Manage Your Content and Devices""), device, or application. For more information click here. Most non-Amazon devices also provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer. If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in Seller Central, update your account information by accessing your Seller Account Information, and adjust your email or other communications you receive from us by updating your Notification Preferences. If you are an author, you can add or update the information you have provided in the Author Portal and Author Central by accessing your accounts in the Author Portal and Author Central, respectively. In addition, to the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request access to or delete your personal information. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact Customer Service. Depending on your data choices, certain services may be limited or unavailable. Are Children Allowed to Use Amazon Services? Amazon does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use Amazon Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without the consent of the child's parent or guardian. For more information, please see our Children's Privacy Disclosure. EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Amazon.com, Inc. participates in the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks.

Understanding Roth IRAs Opening a Roth IRA Are Roth IRAs Insured? What To Contribute to a Roth IRA? Who's Eligible for a Roth IRA? The Spousal Roth IRA Withdrawals: Qualified Withdrawals: Non-Qualified Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA What Is a Roth IRA? A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account (IRA) that allows qualified withdrawals on a tax-free basis provided certain conditions are satisfied. Established in 1997, it was named after William Roth, a former Delaware Senator.﻿﻿ Roth IRAs are similar to traditional IRAs, with the biggest distinction between the two being how they’re taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars; the contributions are not tax-deductible. But once you start withdrawing funds, the money is tax-free. Conversely, traditional IRA deposits are generally made with pretax dollars; you usually get a tax deduction on your contribution and pay income tax when you withdraw the money from the account during retirement.﻿﻿ This and other key differences make Roth IRAs a better choice than traditional IRAs for some retirement savers. Key Takeaways A Roth IRA is a special retirement account where you pay taxes on money going into your account, and then all future withdrawals are tax-free. Roth IRAs are best when you think your taxes will be higher in retirement than they are right now. You can't contribute to a Roth IRA if you make too much money. In 2021, the limit for singles is $140,000. For married couples, the limit is $208,000. The amount you can contribute changes periodically. In 2021, the contribution limit is $6,000 a year unless you are age 50 or older—in which case, you can deposit up to $7,000. Almost all brokerage ﬁrms, both physical and online, offer a Roth IRA. So do most banks and investment companies. Understanding Roth IRAs Similar to other qualified retirement plan accounts, the money invested within the Roth IRA grows tax-free. However, a Roth is less restrictive than other accounts in several ways. Contributions can continue to be made at any age, as long as the account holder has earned income.﻿﻿ The account holder can maintain the Roth IRA indefinitely; there are no required minimum distributions (RMDs) during their lifetime, as there is with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.﻿﻿ A Roth IRA can be funded from a number of sources: Regular contributions Spousal IRA contributions Transfers Rollover contributions Conversions All regular Roth IRA contributions must be made in cash (which includes checks); they can't be in the form of securities or assets. However, a variety of investment options exist within a Roth IRA once the funds are contributed, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, ETFs, CDs, and money market funds.﻿﻿ The IRS limits how much can be deposited in any type of IRA, adjusting the amounts periodically. The contribution limits are the same for traditional and Roth IRAs.﻿﻿ $6,000 The maximum annual contribution an individual can make to a Roth IRA in 2020 remains the same in 2021. Those 50 years old and up can contribute up to $7,000.﻿﻿ Opening a Roth IRA A Roth IRA must be established with an institution that has received IRS approval to offer IRAs. These include banks, brokerage companies, federally insured credit unions, and savings and loan associations. Generally, individuals open IRAs with brokers. A Roth IRA can be established at any time. However, contributions for a tax year must be made by the IRA owner’s tax-filing deadline, which is generally April 15 of the following year. Tax-filing extensions do not apply.﻿﻿ On March 17, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that the federal income tax filing due date for all taxpayers for the 2020 tax year will be automatically extended from April 15, 2021, to May 17, 2021. This pushes other tax-related deadlines back as well; for example, the deadline to make IRA contributions is usually April 15, but taxpayers will have extra time this year. Taxpayers impacted by the 2021 winter storms in Texas will have until June 15, 2021, to file various individual and business tax returns, make tax payments, and make 2020 IRA contributions. (The IRS's extension for victims of the 2021 winter storms was announced on Feb. 22, 2021.) There are two basic documents that must be provided to the IRA owner when an IRA is established: The IRA disclosure statement The IRA adoption agreement and plan document These provide an explanation of the rules and regulations under which the Roth IRA must operate, and establish an agreement between the IRA owner and the IRA custodian/trustee. Not all financial institutions are created equal. Some IRA providers have an expansive list of investment options, while others are more restrictive. Almost every institution has a different fee structure for your Roth IRA, which can have a significant impact on your investment returns. Your risk tolerance and investment preferences are going to play a role in choosing a Roth IRA provider. If you plan on being an active investor and making lots of trades, you want to find a provider that has lower trading costs. Certain providers even charge you an account inactivity fee if you leave your investments alone for too long. Some providers have more diverse stock or exchange traded fund offerings than others; it all depends on the type of investments you want in your account. Pay attention to the specific account requirements as well. Some providers have higher minimum account balances than others. If you plan on banking with the same institution, see if your Roth IRA account comes with additional banking products. If you're looking at opening a Roth at a bank or brokerage where you already have an account, see whether existing customers receive any IRA fee discounts. 2:11 Roth IRA Vs. Traditional IRA Are Roth IRAs Insured? If your account is located at a bank, be aware IRAs fall under a different insurance category than conventional deposit accounts. Therefore, coverage for IRA accounts is not as robust. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) still offers insurance protection up to $250,000 for traditional or Roth IRA accounts, but account balances are combined rather than viewed individually. For example, if the same banking customer has a certificate of deposit held within a traditional IRA with a value of $200,000 and a Roth IRA held in a savings account with a value of $100,000 at the same institution, the account holder has $50,000 of vulnerable assets without FDIC coverage. What Can You Contribute to a Roth IRA? The IRS dictates not only how much money you can deposit in a Roth, but the type of money you can deposit. Basically, you can only contribute earned income to a Roth IRA. For individuals working for an employer, compensation that is eligible to fund a Roth IRA includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other amounts paid to the individual for the services they perform. It's generally any amount shown in Box 1 of the individual's Form W-2. For a self-employed individual or a partner in a partnership, compensation is the individual’s net earnings from their business, less any deduction allowed for contributions made to retirement plans on the individual’s behalf and further reduced by 50% of the individual’s self-employment taxes. Money related to divorce—alimony, child support, or in a settlement—can also be contributed. So what sort of funds aren't eligible? The list includes: Rental income or other profits from property maintenance Interest income Pension or annuity income Stock dividends and capital gains You can never contribute more to your IRA than you earned in that tax year. And, as previously mentioned, you receive no tax deduction for the contribution—although you may be able to take a Saver's Tax Credit of 10%, 20%, or 50% of the deposit, depending on your income and life situation. Who's Eligible for a Roth IRA? Anyone who has taxable income can contribute to a Roth IRA—as long as they meet certain requirements concerning filing status and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Those whose annual income is above a certain amount, which the IRS adjusts periodically, become ineligible to contribute.﻿﻿ The chart below shows the figures for 2020 and 2021.﻿﻿ Do You Qualify for a Roth? Category Income Range for 2020 Contribution Income Range for 2021 Contribution Married and filing a joint tax return Full: Less than $196,000 Partial: From $196,000 to less than $206,000 Full: Less than $198,000 Partial: From $198,000 to less than $208,000 Married, filing a separate tax return, lived with spouse at any time during the year Full: $0 Partial: Less than $10,000 Full: $0 Partial: Less than $10,000 Single, head of household, or married filing separately without living with spouse at any time during the year Full: Less than $124,000 Partial: From $124,000 to less than $139,000 Full: Less than $125,000 Partial: From $125,000 to less than $140,000 ﻿﻿ These individuals must use a formula to determine the maximum amount they may contribute to a Roth IRA. An individual who earns less than the ranges shown for his or her appropriate category can contribute up to 100% of his or her compensation or the contribution limit, whichever is less. Individuals within the phase-out range must subtract their income from the maximum level and then divide that by the phase-out range to determine the percentage of $6,000 they are allowed to contribute. The Spousal Roth IRA One way a couple can boost their contributions: the spousal Roth IRA. An individual may fund a Roth IRA on behalf of their married partner who earns little or no income. Spousal Roth IRA contributions are subject to the same rules and limits as regular Roth IRA contributions. The spousal Roth IRA must be held separately from the Roth IRA of the individual making the contribution, as Roth IRAs cannot be joint accounts.﻿﻿ For an individual to be eligible to make a spousal Roth IRA contribution, the following requirements must be met: The couple must be married and file a joint tax return. The individual making the spousal Roth IRA contribution must have eligible compensation. The total contribution for both spouses must not exceed the taxable compensation reported on their joint tax return. Contributions to one Roth IRA cannot exceed the contribution limits for one IRA (however, the two accounts allow the family to double their annual savings). Withdrawals: Qualified Distributions At any time, you may withdraw contributions from your Roth IRA, both tax- and penalty-free. If you take out only an amount equal to the sum you've put in, the distribution is not considered taxable income and is not subject to penalty, regardless of your age or how long it has been in the account. In IRS-speak, this is known as a qualified distribution. However, there's a catch when it comes to withdrawing account earnings—any returns the account has generated. For distribution of account earnings to be qualified, it must occur at least five years after the Roth IRA owner established and funded his/her first Roth IRA, and the distribution must occur under at least one of the following conditions: The Roth IRA holder is at least age 59½ when the distribution occurs. The distributed assets are used toward the purchase—or to build or rebuild—a first home for the Roth IRA holder or a qualified family member (the IRA owner's spouse, a child of the IRA owner or of the IRA owner's spouse, a grandchild of the IRA owner and/or of their spouse, a parent or other ancestor of the IRA owner or of their spouse). This is limited to $10,000 per lifetime. The distribution occurs after the Roth IRA holder becomes disabled. The assets are distributed to the beneficiary of the Roth IRA holder after the Roth IRA holder's death. The 5-Year Rule Withdrawal of earnings may be subject to taxes and/or a 10% penalty, depending on your age and whether you've met the 5-year rule. Here's a quick rundown. If you meet the 5-year rule: Under 59½: Earnings are subject to taxes and penalties. You may be able to avoid taxes and penalties if you use the money for a first-time home purchase (a $10,000-lifetime limit applies), if you have a permanent disability, or if you pass away (and your beneficiary takes the distribution). Age 59½ and older: No taxes or penalties. If you don’t meet the 5-year rule: Under 59½: Earnings are subject to taxes and penalties. You may be able to avoid the penalty (but not the taxes) if you use the money for a first-time home purchase (a $10,000-lifetime limit applies), qualified education expenses, unreimbursed medical expenses, if you have a permanent disability, or if you pass away (and your beneficiary takes the distribution). 59½ and older: Earnings are subject to taxes but not penalties. Roth withdrawals are made on a FIFO basis (first in, first out)—so any withdrawals made come from contributions first. Therefore, no earnings are considered touched until all contributions have been taken out first. Withdrawals: Non-Qualified Distributions A withdrawal of earnings that do not meet the above requirements is considered a non-qualified distribution and may be subject to income tax and/or a 10% early-distribution penalty. There may be exceptions, however, if the funds are used: For unreimbursed medical expenses. If the distribution is used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses for amounts that exceed 10% of the individual's adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year of the distribution. (That 10% number applies to withdrawals after 2012. Prior to that, it was 7.5% of the AGI.) To pay medical insurance. If the individual has lost his or her job. For qualified higher-education expenses. If the distribution goes toward qualified higher-education expenses of the Roth IRA owner and/or his or her dependents. These qualified education expenses are tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for the enrollment or attendance of a student at an eligible educational institution and must be used in the year of the withdrawal. For childbirth or adoption expenses. Up to $5,000, if made within one year of the event. Note that if you withdraw only the amount of your contributions made within the current tax year—including any earnings on those contributions—the contribution is reversed. For example, If you contribute $5,000 in the current year and those funds generate $500 in earnings, you can withdraw the $5,000 principal tax-free and penalty-free and the $500 gain will be treated as taxable income. Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA Whether or not a Roth IRA is more beneficial than a traditional IRA depends on the tax bracket of the filer, the expected tax rate at retirement, and personal preference. Individuals who expect to be in a higher tax bracket once they retire may find the Roth IRA more advantageous since the total tax avoided in retirement will be greater than the income tax paid in the present. Therefore, younger and lower-income workers may benefit the most from the Roth IRA. Indeed, by beginning to save with an IRA early in life, investors make the most of the snowballing effect of compound interest: Your investment and its earnings are reinvested and generate more earnings, which are reinvested, and so on. Consider opening a Roth over a traditional IRA if you are more interested in tax-free income when you retire than in a tax deduction now when you contribute. Of course, even if you expect to have a lower tax rate in retirement, you'll still enjoy a tax-free income stream from your Roth. Not the worst idea in the world. Those who don't need their Roth IRA assets in retirement can leave the money to accrue indefinitely and pass the assets to heirs tax-free upon death. Even better, while the beneficiary must take distributions from an inherited IRA, they can stretch out tax deferral by taking distributions for a decade and, in some specialized cases, for their lifetimes.﻿﻿ Traditional IRA beneficiaries, on the other hand, do pay taxes on the distributions. Also, a spouse can roll over an inherited IRA into a new account and not have to begin taking distributions until age 72. Some open or convert to Roth IRAs because they fear an increase in taxes in the future, and this account allows them to lock in the current tax rates on the balance of their conversions. Executives and other highly compensated employees who are able to contribute to a Roth retirement plan through their employers [for example, a Roth 401(k)] can also roll these plans into Roth IRAs with no tax consequence and then escape having to take mandatory minimum distributions when they turn 72.

Types of ETFs How to Buy and Sell ETFs Real-World Examples of ETFs Advantages and Disadvantages of ETFs ETF Creation and Redemption What Is an ETF? An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. A well-known example is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index. ETFs can contain many types of investments, including stocks, commodities, bonds, or a mixture of investment types. An exchange traded fund is a marketable security, meaning it has an associated price that allows it to be easily bought and sold. Key Takeaways An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock. ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds that only trade once a day after the market closes.﻿﻿ ETFs can contain all types of investments including stocks, commodities, or bonds; some offer U.S. only holdings, while others are international. ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions than buying the stocks individually. An ETF is called an exchange traded fund since it's traded on an exchange just like stocks. The price of an ETF’s shares will change throughout the trading day as the shares are bought and sold on the market. This is unlike mutual funds, which are not traded on an exchange, and trade only once per day after the markets close. Additionally, ETFs tend to be more cost-effective and more liquid when compared to mutual funds. An ETF is a type of fund that holds multiple underlying assets, rather than only one like a stock. Because there are multiple assets within an ETF, they can be a popular choice for diversification. An ETF can own hundreds or thousands of stocks across various industries, or it could be isolated to one particular industry or sector. Some funds focus on only U.S. offerings, while others have a global outlook. For example, banking-focused ETFs would contain stocks of various banks across the industry. Types of ETFs There are various types of ETFs available to investors that can be used for income generation, speculation, price increases, and to hedge or partly offset risk in an investor's portfolio. Below are several examples of the types of ETFs. Bond ETFs might include government bonds, corporate bonds, and state and local bonds—called municipal bonds. Industry ETFs track a particular industry such as technology, banking, or the oil and gas sector. Commodity ETFs invest in commodities including crude oil or gold. Currency ETFs invest in foreign currencies such as the Euro or Canadian dollar. Inverse ETFs attempt to earn gains from stock declines by shorting stocks. Shorting is selling a stock, expecting a decline in value, and repurchasing it at a lower price. Investors should be aware that many inverse ETFs are exchange traded notes (ETNs) and not true ETFs. An ETN is a bond but trades like a stock and is backed by an issuer like a bank. Be sure to check with your broker to determine if an ETN is a right fit for your portfolio. In the U.S., most ETFs are set up as open-ended funds and are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 except where subsequent rules have modified their regulatory requirements. Open-end funds do not limit the number of investors involved in the product. How to Buy and Sell ETFs ETFs trade through online brokers and traditional broker-dealers. You can view some of the top brokers in the industry for ETFs with Investopedia's list of the best brokers for ETFs. An alternative to standard brokers are robo-advisors like Betterment and Wealthfront who make use of ETFs in their investment products. Real-World Examples of ETFs Below are examples of popular ETFs on the market today. Some ETFs track an index of stocks creating a broad portfolio while others target specific industries. The SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is the oldest surviving and most widely known ETF tracks the S&P 500 Index. The iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) tracks the Russell 2000 small-cap index. The Invesco QQQ (QQQ) indexes the Nasdaq 100, which typically contains technology stocks. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) represents the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Sector ETFs track individual industries such as oil (OIH), energy (XLE), financial services (XLF), REITs (IYR), Biotech (BBH). Commodity ETFs represent commodity markets including crude oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG). Physically-Backed ETFs: The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) hold physical gold and silver bullion in the fund. Advantages and Disadvantages of ETFs ETFs provide lower average costs since it would be expensive for an investor to buy all the stocks held in an ETF portfolio individually. Investors only need to execute one transaction to buy and one transaction to sell, which leads to fewer broker commissions since there are only a few trades being done by investors. Brokers typically charge a commission for each trade. Some brokers even offer no-commission trading on certain low-cost ETFs reducing costs for investors even further. An ETF's expense ratio is the cost to operate and manage the fund. ETFs typically have low expenses since they track an index. For example, if an ETF tracks the S&P 500 index, it might contain all 500 stocks from the S&P making it a passively-managed fund and less time-intensive. However, not all ETFs track an index in a passive manner. Pros Access to many stocks across various industries Low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions. Risk management through diversification ETFs exist that focus on targeted industries Cons Actively-managed ETFs have higher fees Single industry focus ETFs limit diversification Lack of liquidity hinders transactions Actively-Managed ETFs There are also actively managed ETFs, where portfolio managers are more involved in buying and selling shares of companies and changing the holdings within the fund. Typically, a more actively managed fund will have a higher expense ratio than passively managed ETFs. It is important that investors determine how the fund is managed, whether it's actively or passively managed, the resulting expense ratio, and weigh the costs versus the rate of return to make sure it is worth holding. Indexed-Stock ETFs An indexed-stock ETF provides investors with the diversification of an index fund as well as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as little as one share since there are no minimum deposit requirements. However, not all ETFs are equally diversified. Some may contain a heavy concentration in one industry, or a small group of stocks, or assets that are highly correlated to each other. Dividends and ETFs While ETFs provide investors with the ability to gain as stock prices rise and fall, they also benefit from companies that pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of earnings allocated or paid by companies to investors for holding their stock. ETF shareholders are entitled to a proportion of the profits, such as earned interest or dividends paid, and may get a residual value in case the fund is liquidated. ETFs and Taxes An ETF is more tax-efficient than a mutual fund since most buying and selling occurs through an exchange and the ETF sponsor does not need to redeem shares each time an investor wishes to sell, or issue new shares each time an investor wishes to buy. Redeeming shares of a fund can trigger a tax liability so listing the shares on an exchange can keep tax costs lower. In the case of a mutual fund, each time an investor sells their shares they sell it back to the fund and incur a tax liability can be created that must be paid by the shareholders of the fund. ETFs Market Impact Since ETFs have become increasingly popular with investors, many new funds have been created resulting in low trading volumes for some of them. The result can lead to investors not being able to buy and sell shares of a low-volume ETF easily. Concerns have surfaced about the influence of ETFs on the market and whether demand for these funds can inflate stock values and create fragile bubbles. Some ETFs rely on portfolio models that are untested in different market conditions and can lead to extreme inflows and outflows from the funds, which have a negative impact on market stability. Since the financial crisis, ETFs have played major roles in market flash-crashes and instability. Problems with ETFs were significant factors in the flash crashes and market declines in May 2010, August 2015, and February 2018. ETF Creation and Redemption The supply of ETF shares is regulated through a mechanism known as creation and redemption, which involves large specialized investors, called authorized participants (APs). Creation When an ETF wants to issue additional shares, the AP buys shares of the stocks from the index—such as the S&P 500 tracked by the fund—and sells or exchanges them to the ETF for new ETF shares at an equal value. In turn, the AP sells the ETF shares in the market for a profit. The process of an AP selling stocks to the ETF sponsor, in return for shares in the ETF, is called creation. Creation When Shares Trade at a Premium Imagine an ETF that invests in the stocks of the S&P 500 and has a share price of $101 at the close of the market. If the value of the stocks that the ETF owns was only worth $100 on a per share basis, then the fund's price of $101 is trading at a premium to the fund's net asset value (NAV). The NAV is an accounting mechanism that determines the overall value of the assets or stocks in an ETF. An authorized participant has an incentive to bring the ETF share price back into equilibrium with the fund’s NAV. To do this, the AP will buy shares of the stocks that the ETF wants to hold in its portfolio from the market and sells them to the fund in return for shares of the ETF. In this example, the AP is buying stock on the open market worth $100 per share but getting shares of the ETF that are trading on the open market for $101 per share. This process is called creation and increases the number of ETF shares on the market. If everything else remains the same, increasing the number of shares available on the market will reduce the price of the ETF and bring shares in line with the NAV of the fund. Redemption Conversely, an AP also buys shares of the ETF on the open market. The AP then sells these shares back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for individual stock shares that the AP can sell on the open market. As a result, the number of ETF shares is reduced through the process called redemption. The amount of redemption and creation activity is a function of demand in the market and whether the ETF is trading at a discount or premium to the value of the fund's assets. Redemption When Shares Trade at a Discount Imagine an ETF that holds the stocks in the Russell 2000 small-cap index and is currently trading for $99 per share. If the value of the stocks the ETF is holding in the fund is worth $100 per share, then the ETF is trading at a discount to NAV. To bring the ETF’s share price back to its NAV, an AP will buy shares of the ETF on the open market and sell them back to the ETF in return for shares of the underlying stock portfolio. In this example, the AP is able to buy ownership of $100 worth of stock in exchange for ETF shares it bought for $99. This process is called redemption, and it decreases the supply of ETF shares on the market. When the supply of ETF shares is decreased, the price should rise and get closer to its NAV.

How 401(k) Plans Work Taking Withdrawals from a 401(k) Traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k) Special Considerations: When You Leave Your Jobs Frequently Asked Questions What Is a 401(k) Plan? A 401(k) plan is a tax-advantaged, defined-contribution retirement account offered by many employers to their employees. It is named after a section of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Workers can make contributions to their 401(k) accounts through automatic payroll withholding, and their employers can match some or all of those contributions. The investment earnings in a traditional 401(k) plan are not taxed until the employee withdraws that money, typically after retirement. In a Roth 401(k) plan, withdrawals can be tax-free. Key Takeaways A 401(k) plan is a company-sponsored retirement account that employees can contribute to. Employers may also make matching contributions. There are two basic types of 401(k)s—traditional and Roth—which differ primarily in how they're taxed. In a traditional 401(k), employee contributions reduce their income taxes for the year they are made, but their withdrawals are taxed. With a Roth, employees make contributions with post-tax income but can make withdrawals tax-free. For 2020, under the CARES Act, withdrawal rules and amounts were relaxed for those affected by COVID-19, and RMDs were suspended. How 401(k) Plans Work There are two basic types of 401(k) accounts: traditional 401(k)s and Roth 401(k)s, sometimes referred to as a ""designated Roth account."" The two are similar in many respects, but they are taxed in different ways. A worker can have either type of account or both types. Contributing to a 401(k) Plan A 401(k) is what's known as a defined-contribution plan. The employee and employer can make contributions to the account, up to the dollar limits set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By contrast, traditional pensions [not to be confused with traditional 401(k)s] are referred to as defined-benefit plans—the employer is responsible for providing a specific amount of money to the employee upon retirement.﻿﻿ In recent decades, 401(k) plans have become more plentiful, and traditional pensions increasingly rare, as employers have shifted the responsibility and risk of saving for retirement to their employees. Employees are also responsible for choosing the specific investments within their 401(k) accounts, from the selection their employer offers. Those offerings typically include an assortment of stock and bond mutual funds as well as target-date funds that hold a mixture of stocks and bonds appropriate in terms of risk for when that person expects to retire. They may also include guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) issued by insurance companies and sometimes the employer's own stock. Contribution Limits The maximum amount that an employee or employer can contribute to a 401(k) plan is adjusted periodically to account for inflation. As of 2020 and in 2021, the basic limits on employee contributions are $19,500 per year for workers under age 50 and $26,000 for those 50 and up (including the $6,500 catch-up contribution).﻿﻿ If the employer also contributes—or if the employee elects to make additional, non-deductible after-tax contributions to their traditional 401(k) account (if allowed by their plan)—the total employee/employer contribution for workers under 50 for 2021 is capped at $58,000, or 100% of employee compensation, whichever is lower. For those 50 and over, again for 2021, the limit is $64,500.﻿﻿ Employer Matching Employers who match their employee contributions use different formulas to calculate that match. A common example might be 50 cents or $1 for every dollar the employee contributes up to a certain percentage of salary. Financial advisors often recommend that employees try to contribute at least enough money to their 401(k) plans each to get the full employer match. Contributing to a Traditional and Roth 401(k) If they wish—and if their employer offers both choices—employees can split their contributions, putting some money into a traditional 401(k) and some into a Roth 401(k). However, their total contribution to the two types of accounts can't exceed the limit for one account (such as $19,500 (if you are under age 50) in 2020 and 2021).﻿﻿ Employer contributions can only go into a traditional 401(k) account—not a Roth—where they will be subject to tax upon withdrawal. Taking Withdrawals from a 401(k) Participants should remember that once their money is in a 401(k), it may be hard to withdraw without penalty. ""Make sure that you still save enough on the outside for emergencies and expenses you may have before retirement,"" says Dan Stewart, CFA®, president of Revere Asset Management Inc., in Dallas, Texas. ""Do not put all of your savings into your 401(k) where you cannot easily access it, if necessary."" The earnings in a 401(k) account are tax-deferred in the case of traditional 401(k)s and tax-free in the case of Roths. When the owner of a traditional 401(k) makes withdrawals, that money (which has never been taxed) will be taxed as ordinary income. Roth account owners (who have already paid income tax on the money they contributed to the plan) will owe no tax on their withdrawals, as long as they satisfy certain requirements.﻿﻿ Both traditional and Roth 401(k) owners must be at least age 59½—or meet other criteria spelled out by the IRS, such as being totally and permanently disabled—when they start to make withdrawals. Otherwise, they usually will face an additional 10% early-distribution penalty tax on top of any other tax they owe.﻿﻿ Required Minimum Distributions Both types of accounts are also subject to required minimum distributions, or RMDs. (Withdrawals are often referred to as ""distributions"" in IRS parlance.) After age 72, account owners must withdraw at least a specified percentage from their 401(k) plans, using IRS tables based on their life expectancy at the time (prior to 2020, the RMD age had been 70½ years old). If they are still working and the account is with their current employer, however, they may not have to take RMDs from that plan.﻿﻿ ﻿Note that distributions from a traditional 401(k) are taxable. Qualified withdrawals from a Roth 401(k) are not, but they do lose the tax-free growth of being within the 401(k) account. Roth IRAs, unlike Roth 401(k)s, are not subject to RMDs during the owner's lifetime. Traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k) When 401(k) plans first became available in 1978, companies and their employees had just one choice: the traditional 401(k). Then, in 2006, Roth 401(k)s arrived. Roths are named for former U.S. Senator William Roth of Delaware, the primary sponsor of the 1997 legislation that made the Roth IRA possible.﻿﻿ While Roth 401(k)s were a little slow to catch on, many employers now offer them. So the first decision employees often have to make is between Roth and traditional. As a general rule, employees who expect to be in a lower marginal tax bracket after they retire might want to opt for a traditional 401(k) and take advantage of the immediate tax break. On the other hand, employees who expect to be in a higher bracket might opt for the Roth so that they can avoid taxes later. For example, a Roth might be the right choice for a younger worker whose salary is relatively low now but likely to rise substantially over time. Also important—especially if the Roth has years to grow—is that there is no tax on withdrawals, which means that all the money the contributions earn over decades of being in the account is also not taxed. Since no one can predict what tax rates will be decades from now, neither type of 401(k) is a sure thing. For that reason many financial advisors suggest that people hedge their bets, putting some of their money into each. 1:57 Introduction To The 401(K) Special Considerations: When You Leave Your Job When an employee leaves a company where they have a 401(k) plan, they generally have four options: 1. Withdraw the money This is usually a bad idea unless the employee absolutely needs the cash for an urgent purpose, such as a medical bill. Not only will the money be taxable in the year it's withdrawn, but the employee may also be hit with the additional 10% early distribution tax unless they are over 59½, totally and permanently disabled, or meet the other IRS criteria for an exception to the rule.﻿﻿ This rule has been suspended for 2020 for those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted above. In the case of Roth IRAs, the employee's contributions may be withdrawn tax-free and without penalty at any time, but earnings will be taxable if the employee is under 59½ and has had the account for less than five years.﻿﻿ And even if the employee is able to withdraw the money tax-free, they will be diminishing their retirement savings, which they may regret later in life. 2. Roll it over into an IRA By moving the money into an IRA at, say, a brokerage firm or mutual fund company, the employee can avoid immediate taxes and maintain their account's tax-advantaged status. What's more, the employee is likely to have a wider range of investment choices in an IRA than with their employer's plan.﻿﻿ The IRS has relatively strict rules on rollovers and how they need to be accomplished, and running afoul of them can be costly. Typically, the financial institution that is in line to receive the money will be more than happy to help with the process and avoid any missteps. Funds withdrawn from your 401(k) must be rolled over to another retirement account within 60 days to avoid taxes and penalties. 3. Leave it with the old employer In many cases, employers will permit a departing employee to keep a 401(k) account in their old plan indefinitely, although the employee can't make any further contributions to it. This generally applies to accounts worth at least $5,000—in the case of smaller accounts, the employer may give the employee no choice but to move the money elsewhere. Leaving 401(k) money where it is can make sense if the old employer's plan is well managed, and the employee is satisfied with the investment choices it offers. The danger is that employees who change jobs over the course of their careers can leave a trail of old 401(k) plans and may forget about one or more of them. Their heirs might also be unaware of the existence of the accounts. 4. Move it to a new employer Some companies allow new employees to move an old 401(k) into their own plan. As with an IRA rollover, this can maintain the account's tax-deferred status and avoid immediate taxes. It could be a wise move if the employee isn't comfortable with making the investment decisions involved in managing a rollover IRA and would rather leave some of that work to the new plan's administrator. In addition, if the employee is nearing age 72, note that money that is in a 401(k) at one's current employer may not be subject to RMDs. Moving the money will protect more retirement assets under that umbrella. Frequently Asked Questions What is a 401(k) Plan and how does it work? A 401(k) Plan is a defined-contribution retirement account that allows employees to save a portion of their salary in a tax-advantaged manner. The money earned in a 401(k) Plan is not taxed until after the employee retires, at which time their income will typically be lower than during their working years. 401(k) Plans also allow employers to match a portion of the contributions made by the employee, helping to grow their retirement funds even faster. Is it worth having a 401(k) plan? Generally speaking, 401(k) plans can be a great way for employees to save for retirement. However, whether a 401(k) plan is the best option available will depend on the employee’s individual goals and circumstances. All else being equal, employees will have more to gain from participating in a 401(k) plan if their employer offers a more generous contribution-matching program. How much of my salary can I contribute into a 401(k) Plan? The amount that employees can contribute to their 401(k) Plan is adjusted each year to keep pace with inflation. In 2020 and 2021, the limit is $19,500 per year for workers under age 50 and $26,000 for those aged 50 and above. If the employee also benefits from matching contributions from their employer, then the combined contribution from both the employee and the employer is capped at the lesser of $58,000 or 100% of the employee’s compensation for the year.﻿﻿ Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

These technologies help Etsy function, allow us to understand how you use the Services, and have a number of purposes (beyond just advertising) that you can read about in this policy. The previous version of this policy can be found here. In this policy, we'll refer to Etsy.com as the ""Site"" and Etsy's mobile applications as the ""Apps."" We'll refer to the Site, the Apps, Pattern by Etsy, Etsy Payments, and our other services collectively as the ""Services."" Etsy, Inc. and Etsy Ireland UC are referred to as ""Etsy"" throughout this policy. We’ll refer to cookies and similar technologies collectively as “Cookie Technologies.” Types of Cookie Technologies Purposes Services in the Apps (SDKs) Consent, Contract, and Legitimate Interests in Processing Managing Your Cookie Technology Preferences Contact Us 1. Types of Cookie Technologies Cookies Cookies are small data files sent from a server to your web browser. They are stored in your browser’s cache and allow a website or a third party to recognize your browser. There are three primary types of cookies: Session cookies are specific to a particular visit and carry information as you view different pages so you don’t have to re-enter information every time you change pages or attempt to checkout. Session cookies expire and delete themselves automatically in a short period of time like after you leave the Site or when you close your web browser. Persistent cookies remember certain information about your preferences for viewing the site, and allow Etsy to recognize you each time you return. Persistent cookies are stored on your browser cache or mobile device until you choose to delete them, and otherwise typically delete themselves at expiration. Third-party cookies are placed by someone other than Etsy, and may gather browsing activity across multiple websites and across multiple sessions. They are usually a type of persistent cookie and are stored until you delete them or they expire based on the time period set in each third-party cookie. Cookies store data about your use, but they are helpful because they allow us to help Etsy function and customize your experience. You can configure your desktop or mobile browser's settings to reflect your preference to accept or reject cookies, including how to handle third-party cookies (see Managing Your Cookie Technology Preferences below). A description of Etsy’s principal first party cookies can be found in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. Other Technologies In addition to cookies, there are other similar technologies used by Etsy and elsewhere on the web or in mobile ecosystems. Web beacons: These are tiny graphics (sometimes called “clear GIFs” or “web pixels”) with a unique identifier that are used to understand browsing activity. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are rendered invisibly on web pages when you open a page. Social widgets: These are buttons or icons provided by third-party social media providers that allow you to interact with those social media services when you view a web page or a mobile app screen. These social widgets may collect browsing data, which may be received by the third party that provided the widget, and are controlled by the third parties. UTM codes: These are strings that can appear in a URL (the “Uniform Resource Locator,” which is typically the http or https address entered to go to a web page) when a user moves from one web page or website to another, where the string can represent information about browsing, such as which advertisement, page, or publisher sent the user to the receiving website. Application SDKs: These are mobile application third-party software development kits that are embedded in the Apps (and are used in many mobile applications). These app SDKs permit the collection of information about the app itself, activity in the app, and the device the application is running on. Local Storage Objects: These are sets of data that can be stored on your browser by a site or app. They can be used to maintain preferences, a history of usage, or even the state or settings of a site or an app. Internet of Things identifiers: Like mobile identifiers, internet-connected devices such as voice activated assistants or smart TVs may send identifiers and other data analogous to web browsers or mobile SDKs. 2. Purposes Etsy uses Cookie Technologies to recognize your logged-in state on Etsy, to understand what purchases members and visitors are interested in, to make Etsy’s Sites function for you, and to help your browsing experience and use of the Site, Services, and Apps feel more customized. More generally, Etsy uses Cookie Technologies for the following. Security and Authentication (Strictly Necessary) Some cookie and similar technology functions are necessary and vital to ensuring that Etsy works properly for visitors and members, such as maintaining the security, safety, and integrity of the Site, authentication and logging into Etsy (including remembering permissions and consents you have granted), and ensuring the ability to securely complete transactions. Account and User Preferences Some technologies are used to remember your account and preferences over time, such as keeping yourself logged in when returning to Etsy, maintaining your choices on Etsy features and how you want Etsy to appear (including keeping track of your preferred language and country), and customizing content based on how you use Etsy. Social Networks Some technologies help you to interact with social networks you are signed into while using the Services, such as sharing content with the social network, logging in with the social network, and other features you employ with the social network, or that are allowed in the social network’s privacy policy. These may be set and controlled by the social networks, and your preferences with those social networks. Social networks may also work with Etsy or with you for analytics or for marketing purposes, as discussed below. You may be able to manage your privacy preferences for these social networks and their tools and widgets via your account with the social network. You can find more information on specific social media tools and widgets in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. Performance and Analytics Some technologies help provide performance data on how the Services are functioning in order to improve Etsy and the Services, including, for example, data on site and app functionality and speed to help us optimize Etsy, how the Services are used to help us improve your experience on Etsy, and detecting and gathering reporting on bugs to help make Etsy work better. In addition, Etsy may employ transient technologies, including cookies or local stored objects, for site performance, experiments, form information, and interactions with the site, and may use temporary, short-term cookies for limited-time site events such as sales and promotions. The Site employs Google Analytics to help understand how Etsy is used by its community. For some of the advertising features listed below, like retargeting, data from Google Analytics may be combined with Etsy’s first-party data and third-party cookies (like Google’s advertising cookies) as permitted by Google’s and Etsy’s respective policies. To see how to opt-out of Google Analytics Advertising Features, see Managing your Cookie Technology Preferences at the bottom of this policy. The Site also employs Facebook App Events SDKs for analytics in the Apps in a similar fashion, subject to your Opt-Out. You can find more information on how Google Analytics works in this Google guide and on Facebook App Events here. Marketing Services Etsy partners with third-party service providers that may use various Cookie Technologies to permit us and them to learn about which ads you see and click when you visit Etsy, the Apps, and affiliated sites or to show you ads on and off Etsy. These may include things such as: Frequency capping, which limits the number of times a user’s browser or mobile device displays the same ad; Attribution tracking, which estimates which advertising or marketing source brought someone to Etsy, or determines which marketing source led to actions like a visit or a purchase; Remarketing and retargeting, which shows relevant ads to an audience based on prior shopping and browsing patterns on Etsy; Audience targeting, which refers to targeting advertisements to a large audience based on the audience’s known or inferred demographics; and Cross-device recognition, which recognizes actions across multiple devices or browsers. Some third-party service providers may provide information like demographics, cross-device information, or interest categories from a combination of sources that, while not identifying you personally, permit us to provide you with more relevant and useful advertising. In some cases, this information may have non-marketing performance analytics uses as well. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer, mobile device or network device (like an IoT device such as a voice-activated assistant or smart TV), each time you visit Etsy or other websites and mobile applications based on data like a cookie, your IP address, or device ID, but do not allow access to other personal information from Etsy. However, these technologies may allow us or a third party to recognize you, either from a single device or across devices, over time. These third parties are required to follow applicable laws, self-regulatory programs, and Etsy’s data protection rules where applicable. Etsy does not have control over these third parties, who each have their own privacy policies and privacy practices. Etsy adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. For audience targeting, Etsy may share hashed identifiers that represent an email address or name with partners Google and/or Facebook so they can provide Etsy with audiences interested in specific types of products and services. Google and/or Facebook will only provide this information, and can only identify you, based on their separate policies and agreements with their users. More information is provided in Etsy’s Cookies and Similar Technologies Disclosures. You can find a description of third-party Cookie Technologies used by Etsy, along with their respective privacy policies and options for controlling your privacy on these platforms, in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. 3. Services in the Apps (SDKs) The Apps may include third-party application software development kits (“SDKs”) that provide mobile performance and analytics data, bug reporting features, and application program interfaces (""APIs"") to third parties that help provide the Services, for social media functionality, and for marketing and advertising. You can find a description of principal third-party SDKs used by Etsy, along with their respective privacy policies and options for controlling your privacy on these platforms, in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. 4. Consent, Contract, and Legitimate Interests in Processing Certain Cookie Technologies are employed to make the Site function for its intended purpose, and are provided based on contractual necessity based on your agreement with Etsy to perform the services you have requested. These include the functions strictly necessary to the service noted above. By choosing to use our Services after having been notified of our use of Cookie Technologies in the ways described in this Policy, and, in applicable jurisdictions, through notice and unambiguous acknowledgement of your consent, you agree to such use. More information is laid out in our Privacy Policy. 5. Managing Your Cookie Technology Preferences You have the ability to control the use of certain Cookie Technologies. You can opt out of third party marketing cookies and similar technologies via the Privacy Settings link available at the bottom of most Etsy site pages, or via the GDPR Preferences link for users in the European Union and EEA. You can also manage your Etsy marketing preferences in your account settings. As noted previously, information on third party privacy policies and opt-out process can be found in our Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures. Opt-in and Opt-out for Browsers In addition, when you use Etsy via a browser, you can change your web browser's settings to reflect your cookie preferences. Each browser is a little different, but usually these settings are under the ""options"" or ""preferences"" menu. The links below provide information about cookie settings for the browsers supported by Etsy: Microsoft Edge Internet Explorer Firefox Chrome Safari Opt-out of Third-Party Networks If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based advertisements, in addition you may decline to receive interest based ads through TrustE/TrustArc’s preferences manager (or if you are located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not stop you from being served advertisements. You will continue to receive generic advertisements. If you reject or block all cookies in your browser settings, you will not be able to take advantage of Etsy's Services as some cookies are necessary for the Site to function properly. You can learn more about managing your preferences for ads online, particularly for many third-party advertising networks, through resources made available by the Digital Advertising Alliance at https://www.aboutads.info or the Network Advertising Initiative at https://optout.networkadvertising.org. Google Analytics Opt-out For Google Analytics Advertising Features, you can opt-out through Google Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the NAI's consumer opt-out listed above). Google also provides a Google Analytics opt-out plug-in for the web. Third-Party Tools Various third parties provide browser plug-ins and apps that can help provide you information on and limit or block third-party cookies, web beacons, and some Javascript-based technologies. Etsy cannot vouch for the efficacy of a particular third-party product, but popular products that provide these privacy enhancements include Ghostery and AdBlock Plus. Both Google and Facebook provide tools to control use of advertising on their respective platforms, including advertising on and with Etsy. More information can be found in your account settings on the respective platforms, including in Google’s Privacy Center and in Facebook’s Ad Settings. Mobile and Third Party Device Opt-out If you access Etsy through the Apps, you may also control interest-based advertising on an iOS or Android device by selecting the “Limit Ad Tracking” option in the privacy section of the Settings App on iOS or via advertising preferences on Android-based devices (usually in the Google Settings app). This will not prevent you from seeing advertisements but will limit the use of device advertising identifiers to personalize ads based on your interests. For third party IoT devices such as voice activated assistants or smart TVs, consult with the manufacturer and/or service provider for the opt out mechanism for their respective devices and services. 6.
